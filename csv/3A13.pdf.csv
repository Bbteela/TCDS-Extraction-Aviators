 Special Ferry Flight Authorization. Flight Standards District Offices are authorized to issue Special 
 overweight ferry flight authorizations. These airplanes are structurally satisfactory for ferry flight if 
 maintained within the following limits: (1) Takeoff weight must not exceed 130% of the maximum weight 
 for Normal Category; and (2) The Never Exceed Airspeed (VNE) and Maximum Structural Cruising Speed 
 (VC) must be reduced by 30%; and (3) Forward and aft center of gravity limits may not be exceeded; and (4) 
 Structural load factors of +2.5 g. to -1.0 g. may not be exceeded. Requirements for any additional engine oil 
 should be established in accordance with Advisory Circular AC23.1011-1. Increased stall speeds and 
 reduced climb performance should be expected for the increased weights. Flight characteristics and 
 performance at the increased weights have not been evaluated. Procedures for issuing a Flight Permit for 
 operations of overweight aircraft may be found in Advisory Circular AC21-4B 
 In addition to the above specified placards, the prescribed operating limitations indicated by an asterisk (*) under 
 Sections I through XII must also be displayed by permanent markings.

 within the following limits: (1) Takeoff weight must not exceed 130% of the maximum weight for Normal 
 Category; and (2) The Never Exceed Airspeed (VNE) and Maximum Structural Cruising Speed (VC) must be 
 reduced by 30%; and (3) Forward and aft center of gravity limits may not be exceeded; and (4) Structural 
 load factors of +2.5 g. to -1.0 g. may not be exceeded. Requirements for any additional engine oil should be 
 established in accordance with Advisory Circular AC23.1011-1. Increased stall speeds and reduced climb

 within the following limits: (1) Takeoff weight must not exceed 130% of the maximum weight for Normal 
 Category; and (2) The Never Exceed Airspeed (VNE) and Maximum Structural Cruising Speed (VC) must be 
 reduced by 30%; and (3) Forward and aft center of gravity limits may not be exceeded; and (4) Structural 
 load factors of +2.5 g. to -1.0 g. may not be exceeded. Requirements for any additional engine oil should be 
 established in accordance with Advisory Circular AC23.1011-1. Increased stall speeds and reduced climb 
 performance should be expected for the increased weights. Flight characteristics and performance at the 
 increased weights have not been evaluated. Procedures for issuing a Flight Permit for operations of 
 overweight aircraft may be found in Advisory Circular AC21-4B.
