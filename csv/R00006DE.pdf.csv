 Certification Basis General Note: Any alteration to the aircraft for Special Purposes not identified above 
 require further FAA approval and in addition may require noise and/or flight testing. 
 Model OH-58A: 
 FAR 21.25(a)(2) effective February 1, 1965, including Amendments 21-1 through 21-71.

 Note: In accordance with FAR 36.1(a)(4), compliance with the noise requirements was not 
 shown for the Model OH-58A. Therefore, Model OH-58A aircraft certificated under this 
 type certificate are only eligible for the Special Purposes of External Load Operations, Forest 
 and Wildlife Conservation and Agricultural Operations as listed above. 
 Model OH-58A+ and OH-58C: 
 FAR 21.25(a)(2) effective February 1, 1965, including Amendments 21-1 through 21-71.

 (5) Patrolling Operations under FAR 21.25(b)(4). See Note 20. 
 Note: In accordance with FAR 36.1(a)(4), compliance with the nose requirements has been 
 shown for Garlick Models OH-58+ and OH-58C. No determination has been made by the 
 Federal Aviation Administration that the noise levels of this aircraft are or should be 
 acceptable or unacceptable for operation at, into, or out of, any airport. 
 General Note: Any subsequent modifications to the helicopters type certified under this Type 
 Certificate are to have the certification basis for that modification established under 14CFR 
 21.101 published June 7, 2000 which became effective June 10, 2003. Otherwise non- 
 significant modifications are to meet the requirements of 14 CFR 27 airworthiness standards,
