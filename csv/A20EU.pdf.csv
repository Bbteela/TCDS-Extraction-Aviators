 Service Information 
 Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the European 
 Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before September 28, 2003 – 
 by RLD or CAA-NL. Any such documents are accepted by the FAA and are considered 
 FAA approved: 
 Instructions for Continued Airworthiness consisting of: 
 - Structural Repair Manual 
 - Service Bulletins 
 - Structural Inspection Program (SIP) Document 
 - Airworthiness Recommendations Catalog (ARC) 
 - Corrosion Control Program (CCP) Document 
 - Maintenance Schedule, Maintenance Data or Custormer Maintenance 
 Program (ref. NTO 182) 
 Service bulletins, repair instructions (letters, drawings, specifications, forms used for 
 transmitting repair descriptions, etc.), structural repair manuals, airplane flight manuals, 
 vendor manuals, and overhaul and maintenance manuals that are published 
 in the English language and indicate applicability to the U.S. approved type designs 
 included in this Type Certificate and that include a statement “RLD, CAA/NL or EASA 
 Approved” are accepted by the FAA and are considered “FAA Approved.” 
 Additionally, Fokker Services as a DOA holder has been given authorization by EASA to 
 approve Service Bulletins (SB) that are not associated with Airworthiness Directives. 
 Accordingly, Service Bulletins and repair instructions which contain a statement “The 
 technical content of this document is approved under the authority of DOA ref. 
 EASA.21J.059” are considered EASA approved and are therefore accepted by the FAA 
 and are considered FAA approved. 
 For approvals made before September 28, 2003 the statement “The technical information 
 contained in this document has been approved under the authority of FAA Design 
 Organization Approval no. RLD.JA.001” may have been used and are also considered 
 FAA approved.
