 A273102, B273109 and A551001 as contained in Model 425 Maintenance Manual, Part Number D2535-3-13, 
 Revision 3 (or later revision). These inspection criteria are contained in Chapter 5, Subsection 5-10-01, and are 
 applicable to Zones 331 and 332. All approved airplane inspection programs must include these mandatory 
 inspections."
