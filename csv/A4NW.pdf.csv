NOTE 3,Reserved.
NOTE 4,"The DW-1 (serial numbers DW-1-0002 and up) has demonstrated satisfactory operation at 5400 pounds 
 gross weight in the restricted category envelope at sea level under standard day conditions. Further weight 
 increases should not be accomplished in the field. 
 The design maximum takeoff and landing weight is 4000 pounds. Since the hopper load is disposable, 
 landings in excess of this weight should not be required. If it is necessary to make a landing weight over 
 4000 pounds, the pilot must exercise caution to prevent structural damage to the landing gear and airframe. 
 The takeoff weight should be adjusted also, to suit the runway surface to prevent over-stressing the 
 structure."
NOTE 5,"Airplane Serial No. DW-1-0001 was extensively damaged and cannot be rebuilt to the original certified 
 configuration due to insufficient type design data. This airplane is no longer eligible for a Restricted 
 Category Airworthiness Certificate."
