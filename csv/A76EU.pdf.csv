Validation Basis,"The Civil Aviation Authority of the Czech Republic (CAA-CZ) originally type 
 certificated these aircraft models under its type certificate Numbers CZ 92-03 (Z242L) 
 and CZ 94-08 (Z143L). The FAA validated this product under U.S. Type Certificate 
 Number A76EU. Effective February 1, 2005 the European Aviation Safety Agency

 TCDS numbers are EASA.A.027 (Z242L) and EASA.A.028 (Z143L).Type Certificate 
 A76EU was issued pursuant to FAR 21.29 in validation of the Civil Aviation Authority 
 (CAA) certification of compliance with aforementioned certification basis, and in 
 accordance with the standard airworthiness certificate provisions of FAR 21.183(c)."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for airworthiness certification. 
 In addition, the following items of equipment are required.

 • Structural repair manuals, 
 • Vendor manuals, 
 • Aircraft flight manuals, and 
 • Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved for type design

 • The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures of the FAA 
 approved manuals; or 
 •The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this product’s U.S. type 
 certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. The 
 FAA may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to approve on behalf of the FAA for the 
 U.S. type certificate. If this is the case it will be noted on the document."
NOTE 1,"A current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in the certificated empty weight,
