 E. Eng. R.D. 2451 (Issue 2, or later issue) to approved limitations. 
 Approved deviations 
 Fuels with the following deviations from Specification D. Eng. R.D. 2494 are 
 acceptable: 
 Flash point: 
 Minimum 28 deg. C. 
 (82.4 deg. F.) 
 Mercaptan 
 Maximum 0.005 per cent 
 sulphur content: 
 by weight 
 Mixing of fuels 
 Any mixture of the above type fuels may be used without readjustment of the 
 engine fuel control unit and without loss in engine power or aircraft performance. 
 Wide-Cut Fuel 
 The use of wide-cut fuel, as agreed to by the Operator, Rolls-Royce and 
 appropriate Airworthiness Authority may result in a reduction in H.P. fuel 
 pump life. 
 Fuel conforming to emergency fuel specification ES-2-74 may be used on an 
 exception basis. 
 Refer to Airplane Flight Manual for approved fuel additives.

 Compliance with the following optional requirements has been established: 
 Ice Protection CAR 4b.640. 
 Data covering ditching requirements of 4b.361 including 4b.362(d) and 4b.742(e) 
 (but excluding 4b.645 and 4b.646) are approved. When the operating rules 
 require emergency ditching equipment, compliance with 4b.645 and 4b.646 must 
 be demonstrated. Grumman Report 1159-GER-7, revised July 25, 1977, entitled 
 ""Outfitting Requirements for FAA Certification for Ditching,"" provides an 
 acceptable means for showing compliance with 4b.645 and 4b.646. Airplane Flight 
 Manual Interim Revision 22.3, or later FAA approved revision must be incorporated."
Production Basis,"None. Prior to original certification of aircraft manufactured subsequent to serial 
 numbers 1 through 12, 14 through 112, 114 through 200, plus 322 and 323, an FAA 
 representative must perform a detailed inspection for workmanship, materials and 
 conformity with the approved data, and a check of the flight characteristics (see 
 NOTE 5.)"
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. In addition, 
 the following items of equipment are required: 
 a. 
 FAA approved Airplane Flight Manual, dated May 21, 1959. Reissued July 1, 1960. 
 b. Crew oxygen system installation. When an aircraft is outfitted to carry passengers, 
 an FAA approved passenger oxygen system must be installed."
Service Information,"Service bulletins and other service information, when FAA approved, will carry a 
 statement to that effect. See NOTE 4 regarding Grumman Gulfstream Service Change 
 Number 147."
NOTE 1,"(a) 
 Current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and 
 loading instructions when necessary, must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original certification. 
 (b) 
 System or unusable fuel, which must be included in the empty weight, is the amount of fuel required to fill 
 the system plumbing and tank to the undrainable level (2.4 gal. total), plus unavailable fuel in the fuel tanks 
 (8.3 gal. total). The total amount of ""system fuel"" 10.7 gal. total, 72 lb. (325). System or unusable and 
 undrainable water/methanol are in identical quantity (3.4 gal. or 27 lb. total) and also must be included in 
 the empty weight (325). For aircraft with outer wing panel fuel tank installation (Service Change No. 125), 
 system water/methanol equals 1.8 gal. or 14 lb. total (346). 
 (c) 
 System oil, which must be included in empty weight, is the amount of oil necessary for engine lubrication 
 and propeller operation. The total amount of ""system oil"" is as follows: 5.7 gal. (total) contained in engines, 
 45.8 lb. (200.5)."
NOTE 2,"The following placards must be displayed in the locations indicated: 
 (a)

 (b) 
 On the instrument panel below r.p.m. indicators: 
 ""Avoid all continuous operation below 7000 RPM."" 
 (c) 
 On aircraft serial numbers 3 and 114 adjacent to each swivel seat: 
 ""This seat must be forward facing during take-off and landing."" 
 (d) 
 On aircraft serial numbers 2, 3, and 114 on the back rest of the jump seat: 
 ""Not to be used during take-off and landing."" 
 (e) 
 On the forward side of the passenger compartment rear door: (This placard is required for 24 passenger

NOTE 3,"Retirement Times: 
 The retirement times of fatigue critical life limited components are listed in Section IV, Part 1 of the Gulfstream 
 Aerospace Model 159 (Gulfstream I) Inspection Schedule Manual. The retirement times of these life limited 
 components cannot be increased/changed without FAA Engineering approval."
NOTE 4,"Grumman Gulfstream Service Change No. 147 regarding large cargo door may be incorporated when the
