Certification Basis,"CAR 6, dated December 20, 1956, including amendments 6-1 through 6-4 
 and Special Conditions, ""Conditions Establishing Compensating Factors 
 Providing an Equivalent Level of Safety under Civil Air Regulations, 
 Section 6.10 for Light Turbine Powered Helicopters"", dated October 2, 
 1962, except condition 15a. Type Certificate H2WE issued May 22, 1964. 
 Date of application for Type Certificate November 13, 1961. 
 FAA Exemption No. 596 issued October 18, 1966, grants exemption from 
 FAR 6.328 to the extent necessary to permit the Type Certification of The 
 Fairchild Hiller Model FH-1100 without the necessity of considering the 
 jamming of a control valve or the cracking of the actuator cylinder as 
 possible failures."
Production Basis,"None. Prior to original certification of each aircraft manufactured 
 subsequent to April 20, 1994, an FAA representative must perform a 
 detailed inspection for workmanship, materials, and conformity with the 
 approved technical data and a check of the flight characteristics."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (See certification basis) must be installed in the helicopter for 
 certification. Hiller Report 63-96, ""Master Equipment List, Model 1100"" 
 and Hiller Report 66-19 ""Basic Weight Equipment List"", Model FH-1100, 
 contain a list of all required equipment that must be installed as well as 
 optional equipment installations approved by the FAA."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in certificated empty 
 weight, and loading instructions must be in each helicopter at the time of original certification and 
 at all times thereafter (except in the case of operators having an approved weight control system). 
 Ballast, when necessary, must be carried in accordance with Loading Instructions in the FAA 
 Approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual. Fuel and Oil capacities as indicated are total tank capacities 
 over and above ""Trapped Fuel and Oil"". The fuel tank capacity includes ""Unusable"" fuel of 2.5 
 gallons, for Model 1100 and 1.6 gallons (10.8 lbs.) for Model FH-1100 which cannot be used 
 safely in all normal expected flight attitudes and must be included in the empty weight."
NOTE 2,"The following placard must be installed in clear view of the pilot: 
 ""This Helicopter must be operated in compliance with the operating limitations specified in the 
 FAA Approved Rotorcraft flight Manual"". 
 For additional placards, see the FAA Approved Flight Manual."
NOTE 3,"The retirement times of critical parts are listed in the following tables. These values of retirement 
 of service life cannot be increased without FAA Engineering approval.
