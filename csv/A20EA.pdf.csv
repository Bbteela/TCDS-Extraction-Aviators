 DHC-7-103 (Transport Category) Approved May 2, 1979 
 The DHC-7-101 is the same as the DHC-7-100 except that a large cargo door in the forward left hand side of the cabin has 
 replaced the Type III emergency exit in that position. Two additional Type III exits are located on each side at 
 approximately the mid cabin. A cargo/passenger interior with a structurally strengthened cabin floor is standard. 
 The DHC-7-103 is the same as the DHC-7-102 except for those same differences between the DHC-7-101 and DHC-7-100 
 stated above. (See Note 4 for conversion from -100 to -102 or from -101 to -103.)
