Import Requirements,"A United States Certificate of Airworthiness may be issued on the basis of a 
 CAAC Certificate of Airworthiness for Export, signed by a representative of the 
 CAAC Authority, containing the following statement: ""The airplane covered by 
 this certificate has been examined, tested and found to conform to the type 
 design approved under FAA Type Certificate A00006WI, and is in a condition 
 for safe operation."" 
 Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA) complying with FAR 23.1529, 
 must be furnished before delivery of the first airplane or issuance of a US 
 standard certificate of airworthiness, whichever occurs later. As of February 5,

 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into 
 the United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the 
 agreement, to identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the 
 export certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures 
 for coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer 
 to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements 
 for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft.
