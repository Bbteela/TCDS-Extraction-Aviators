Production basis,Production Certificate No. 600.
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the helicopter for 
 certification. Lockheed Report 19208, Section IIA “Equipment List,” contains 
 a list of all required equipment that must be installed as well as optional 
 equipment installations approved by the FAA."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including lisdt of equipment included in certificated empty weight, 
 and loading instructions, must be provided for each helicopter at the time of original airworthiness 
 certification and at all times thereafter (except in the case of operators having an approved weight 
 control system). 
 Fuel and oil capacities as indicated are total tank capacities over and above “Trapped Fuel and Oil.” 
 The indicated capacity of the fuel tank does not include “Unusable” fuel of 10 pounds which cannot 
 be used safely in all flight attitudes, and which must be included in the empty weight."
NOTE 2,"The following placard must be installed in the Pilot’s Checklist: 
 “This helicopter must be operated in compliance with the operating limitations specified in the FAA 
 Approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual.” 
 For additional placards, see FAA Approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual."
NOTE 3,"The retirement times of critical parts are listed in the following table. These values of 
 retirement or service life cannot be increased without FAA Engineering Approval. 
 Life limited components removed when life limit has been reached must be destroyed or 
 permanently marked to prevent return to service.
