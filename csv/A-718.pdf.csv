 Equipment 
 A plus (+) or minus (-) sign preceding the weight of an item indicates net weight change when 
 that item is installed. Approval for the installation of all items of equipment listed herein has 
 been obtained by the aircraft manufacturer except those items preceded by an asterisk (*). 
 This symbol denotes that approval has been obtained by someone other than the aircraft 
 manufacturer. An item marked with an asterisk may not have been manufactured under an 
 FAA monitored or approved quality control system, and therefore conformity must be 
 determined if the item is not identified by a Form FAA-186 or 8130-3 Airworthiness Approval
