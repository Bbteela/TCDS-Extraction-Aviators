 The CAAC Certificate of Airworthiness for Export must be submitted for each 
 individual airplane. See ""Import Requirements."" 
 Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA) complying with FAR 23.1529, 
 must be furnished before delivery of the first airplane or issuance of a standard 
 certificate of airworthiness, whichever occurs later. As of April 3, 2008, the 
 FAA has not accepted the ICAs."
Import Requirements,"a. A United States airworthiness certificate may be issued on the basis of a 
 Chinese Certificate of Airworthiness for Export signed by a representative of 
 the Civil Aviation Authority of China (CAAC), containing the following 
 statement (in the English language). “The aircraft covered by this certificate 
 has been examined, tested, and found to comply with U.S. type certificate 
 No. A48CE and to be in a condition for safe operation.” 
 b. The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 
 FAR Section 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR 
 Sections 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). 
 c. The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 
 FAR Section 21.29 exported from countries other than the country of 
 manufacture (e.g., third party country) is FAR Section 21.183(d) or 
 21.183(b). 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into 
 the United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the 
 agreement, to identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the 
 export certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures 
 for coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer 
 to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements 
 for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft."
