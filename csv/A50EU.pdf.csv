 Certificate of Airworthiness for Export signed by a representative of the Swiss 
 Federal Air Office, containing the following statement: 
 ""The airplane covered by this certificate has been examined, tested and found to 
 conform to the type design approved under Type Certificate No. A50EU, and to 
 be in condition for safe operation."" 
 Airplane S/N 395 is eligible for a U.S. standard Airworthiness Certificate when 
 the requirements of 14 CFR Sections 45.11 and 45.13, and all other import 
 requirements of this type certificate data sheet are satisfied. 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the 
 United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, 
 to identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the export 
 certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures for 
 coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to 
 FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements for 
 issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft."
Serial Nos Eligible,"A Certificate of Airworthiness for Export endorsed as noted under ""Import 
 Requirements"" must be submitted for each individual aircraft for which 
 application for U.S. Certification is made."
Service Information,"Service bulletins, structural repair manuals, vendor manuals, aircraft flight 
 manuals, and overhaul and maintenance manuals, should contain a statement that 
 the document is approved by the Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA). 
 (NOTE 2, NOTE 3 and NOTE 4) 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved for type design data 
 only unless one of the following conditions exists: 
 • The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures of the FAA approved 
 manuals; or 
 • The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this product’s U.S. type 
 certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. The FAA 
 may delegate on case-by-case to FOCA to approve on behalf of the FAA for the U.S. type 
 certificate. If this is the case it will be noted on the document."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment in certificated empty 
 weight, and loading instructions, must be provided for each aircraft at the time of 
 original certification. 
 The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of gravity location must include 
 full oil (31.65 lbs at + 7.66 ft), and unusable fuel (28.66 lbs. at + 15.39 ft)."
NOTE 2,"All placards required in the approved Airplane Flight Manual must be installed on the 
 airplane in the appropriate location. Revisions to this report may be approved by 
 FOCA on behalf of the FAA, unless they are changes to the limitation section. These 
 changes require FAA approval for the US version."

 Aircraft Maintenance Manual, Document No. 01715, presents the airworthiness 
 limitations, overhaul limitations (TBO), scheduled and unscheduled maintenance checks.
