"II. Model Astra SPX (Transport Category) Approved January 8, 1996 
 The Model Astra SPX is a derivative of the Model 1125 Westwind Astra. The changes include: installation of Honeywell (formerly 
 AlliedSignal) TFE 731-40R-200G engines; installation of winglets and minor structural modifications to the wing; installation of 
 Collins pro-line 4 avionics; and a new Airplane Flight Manual to take credit for the aerodynamic and performance improvements. 
 III. Model Gulfstream 100 (Transport Category) Approved August 9, 2002 
 The Model Gulfstream 100 type design is identical to the Model Astra SPX type design except for the model designation. The only 
 difference is the model designation (name) used on the data plate and associated manuals. The type design of the Model Gulfstream 
 100 includes all of the mandatory type design changes applied to the Astra SPX as of the date of approval. 
 IV. Model Gulfstream G150 (Transport Category) Approved November 7, 2005 
 The “GULFSTREAM G150” is a derivative model of the former “GULFSTREAM G100”. The changes include: 
 - A 5.5% increase of maximum takeoff weight 
 - A12-inch increase in the passenger cabin width 
 -A16 inch fuselage “Plug” aft of rear pressure bulkhead 
 - A modified cockpit and nose section with enhanced pilot accommodation and visibility 
 - COLLINS PROLINE 21 avionics in lieu of the COLLINS PROLINE 4 
 - Systems adaptations associated with the aforementioned modifications
