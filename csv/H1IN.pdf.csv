Serial Nos Eligible,"The French Government ""Certificat de Navigabilite pour Exportation"" endorsed as noted 
 under ""Import Requirements"" must be submitted for each individual helicopter for which 
 application for certification is made. For applications for Standard Airworthiness 
 Certificates made after May1, 2004, a review of historical records is needed to determine 
 if the helicopter was delivered to and operated by the military. If the helicopter has 
 military history, the helicopter is not eligible for a Standard Airworthiness Certificate 
 unless a copy of a Standard Airworthiness Certificate issued at the time of delivery to the 
 military is submitted."
Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on a National Aviation Authority 
 (NAA) Export Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of 
 the French Generale de l’Aviation Civile (DGAC) on behalf of the European Community. 
 The Export C of A should contain the following statement: “The aircraft covered by this 
 certificate has been examined, tested, and found to comply with the type design approved 
 under U.S. Type Certificate Number H1IN and to be in a condition for safe operation.” 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness (or 
 equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of 
 Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft."
Certification Basis,"CAR 10 (FAR 21.29) CAR 6, 20 December 1956, plus Amendments 6.1 through 6.4 
 and Special Requirements notified to the French Government by the U.S. Government, 
 in letters dated 3 May 1960 and 13 September 1961. 
 Type Certificate No. H1IN issued 27 March 1962 for the SE.3160 Alouette III. 
 Type Certificate No. H1IN amended 25 March 1971 to add the SA.316B 
 Alouette III. 
 Type Certificate No. H1IN amended 25 February 1972 to add the SA.315B 
 Alouette III. 
 Type Certificate No. H1IN amended 20 November 1972 to add the SA.319B Alouette III 
 and the SA.316C Alouette III. 
 Date of Application for Type Certificate: 28 July 1961. 
 The French Direction Generale de l’Aviation Civile (DGAC) originally type certificated 
 this rotorcraft under its type certificate TC 14. The FAA validated this product under U.S. 
 Type Certificate Number H1IN. Effective September 28, 2003, the European Aviation 
 Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this product on behalf of the DGAC."
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the European 
 Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before September 28, 2003 – by 
 the French Generale de l’Aviation Civile (DGAC). Any such documents are accepted by 
 the FAA and are considered FAA approved. 
 • 
 Service Bulletin, 
 • 
 Structural repair manuals, 
 • 
 Vendor manuals, 
 • 
 Aircraft flight manuals, and 
 • 
 Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 This applies only to the acceptance of the type design data."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (See Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. In addition, the 
 following items of equipment are required: 
 SGAC-approved Helicopter Flight Manual (English language version). 
 Ambient air temperature gauge."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report, including loading instructions and list of equipment included in the 
 certificated empty weight, must be provided for each helicopter at the time of original certification. In order 
 to obtain the most consistent weight and balance results, all helicopters should be weighed on jackpoints rather 
 than on wheels and floats. When changes are made to the helicopter that affect the weight and balance, refer 
 to the Flight Manual for instructions. 
 The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of gravity locations must include unusable fuel of 18 
 lb. (120.8), and undrainable oil of 1.5 lb. (138.6)."
NOTE 2,"The following placard must be displayed in clear view of the pilot: 
 ""THIS HELICOPTER MUST BE OPERATED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE 
 OPERATING LIMITATIONS SPECIFIED IN THE APPROVED FLIGHT MANUAL"" 
 The other placards as indicated in the Helicopter Flight Manual must be installed in the appropriate 
 location."
NOTE 3,"Information essential to the proper maintenance of the helicopter is contained in the Manufacturer's 
 Maintenance Manual provided with each helicopter. The retirement times of critical parts are listed in 
 Chapter 5, approved by SGAC."
NOTE 4,Revision 8 to the TCDS changed the company name from Eurocopter France to Airbus Helicopters.
NOTE 5,"Effective January 1, 2014, Eurocopter France name was changed to Airbus Helicopters."
