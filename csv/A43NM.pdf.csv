 Type A340-500 Series Transport Category Airplanes 
 Airbus A340-541 - approved January 27, 2003 
 The A340-500 series is shorter than the A340-600 by 14 frames. It is intended for long range operations having additional fuel capacity 
 over that of the A340-600 with the installation of a rear center tank (RCT).

 The following table provides a list of required design improvement modifications for the 5-frame RCT (defined by Airbus modification 
 no. 47020) on Model A340-500 series aircraft. The modifications extend the Kevlar liner in the RCT and improve the RCT fuel jettison 
 rate. Airbus modifications 51344 and 51452 are required as a condition for type certification and must be installed prior to issuance of a 
 standard US airworthiness certificate

 Import Requirements 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any required 
 statements on the export certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to 
 conformity statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, provisions for Import 
 Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate. 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 14 CFR 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture 
 is 14 CFR 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 14 CFR 21.29 exported 
 from countries other than the country manufacture (e.g., third party country) is 14 CFR 21.183(d) or 21.183(b). 
 FAA Required Airworthiness Action List for Airbus Model A340 Aircraft 
 In order for the FAA to determine that an A340 aircraft is in a condition for safe operation under the provisions of 14 CFR 21.183, the 
 Branch, Compliance & Airworthiness Division, Aircraft Certification Service, 2200 South 216th Street Des Moines, Washington 98198, 
 telephone (206)-231-3219, prior to issuance of the U.S. airworthiness certificate to obtain the FAA Required Airworthiness Action List 
 RAAL for the A340 
 design is currently registered in the U.S. (ref. Federal Register Volume 63, No. 84, May 1, 1998, docket 98-11648) the A340 Required 
 Modification List (RML) is removed from the A340 TCDS at revision 10. Modifications defined in the A340 RML are transferred into 
 A340 Required Airworthiness Action List (RAAL). The RAAL is maintained by the Large Aircraft Section, International Validation 
 Branch, Compliance & Airworthiness Division, Aircraft Certification Service, 2200 South 216th Street Des Moines, Washington 98198, 
 telephone (206)-231-3219. After the first airplane is imported to the U.S. the RAAL will be finalized and published in the TCDS. When 
 the TCDS is amended to include the RAAL, a notice will be published in the Federal Register, to inform the public of this amendment. 
 Agency (EASA), which is the state of design authority for the A340, to be required to correct unsafe conditions discovered on the original 
 type design of the A340. EASA has issued Airworthiness Directives – MCAI - that require the accomplishment of these modifications 
 and inspections to correct the identified unsafe conditions, and has advised the FAA of this MCAI. Based on this MCAI the FAA has 
 determined that the airworthiness actions identified in the EASA MCAI listed in A340 RAAL are required in the interest of safety and 
 are necessary for this airplane to be in a condition for safe operation. 
 Prior to issuance of a Standard Airworthiness Certificate on any A340 model aircraft, all airworthiness actions listed in the A340 RAAL 
 must be accomplished in accordance with the compliance times listed in each MCAI, except as noted in the RAAL. The MCAI listed in 
 the RAAL are airworthiness limitations in addition to those listed in note 3 of this TCDS, and must be included in the operator’s airplane 
 maintenance or inspection program. All inspections or modifications, required by the EASA MCAI, that have surpassed the initial 
 compliance time, must be accomplished prior to issuance of the Standard Airworthiness Certificate. 
 Any deviation from the requirements of the MCAIs, listed in the RAAL, must be approved by the Manager, Large Aircraft Section, 
 International Validation Branch, Compliance & Airworthiness Division, Aircraft Certification Service, 2200 South 216th Street Des 
 Moines Washington 98198 telephone 2062313219
