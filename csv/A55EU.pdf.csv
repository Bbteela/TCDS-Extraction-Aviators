Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export Certificate of 
 Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the Civil Aviation Office (CAO) of 
 Poland on behalf of the European Community. The Export C of A should contain the following 
 statement: ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to 
 comply with U.S. airworthiness regulations 14 CFR Federal Aviation Regulations Part 23, U.S. 
 Type Certificate No. A55EU and to be in a condition for safe operation.’ 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness 
 (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification 
 of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported 
 aircraft."
