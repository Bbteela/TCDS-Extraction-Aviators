 Takeoff and maximum continuous horsepower ratings are normally obtained at a power 
 turbine speed of 18,966 r.p.m. (100%Nf). 
 Total power for two-engine operation is limited to 2300 hp. for takeoff for S-61L 
 rotorcraft. Maximum continuous total power for two-engine operation is limited to 
 2100 hp. 
 Two-engine operational limits are increased to 2500 hp. for takeoff when the S6135- 
 20600-1 through -15, -18, -19, or 23 through 41 main transmission is installed. The 
 maximum continuous limit of 2100 hp. is unchanged. 
 Below 59°F the sea-level static power limits vary as follows:
