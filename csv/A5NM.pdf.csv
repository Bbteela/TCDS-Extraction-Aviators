Production Basis,"None - Prior to original airworthiness certification of each aircraft, a FAA 
 representative must perform inspection for workmanship, materials and conformity with 
 the approved technical data and a check of the flight characteristics."
Required Equipment,"In addition to the basic required equipment specified in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations, the equipment specified in Hawkins and Powers Aviation, Inc. Document 
 HPA-97-101, dated 24 September 1982 or later, FAA approved revision thereto must be 
 installed."
NOTE 1,"This approval applies to USAF (Boeing) KC97G aircraft with the modification described in Hawkins and 
 Powers Aviation, Inc., FAA approved drawing list HPA-97-DL2, dated November 20,1981 or later approved 
 revisions thereto."
NOTE 2,"The aircraft must be serviced and maintained in accordance with USAF Technical Manual T.O. 
 1C-97 (K) E (C) -2-1."
NOTE 3,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and 
 loading instructions when necessary must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original certification. 
 After original certification the effects on weight and balance due to changes in equipment and/or 
 alterations must be suitably accounted for."
NOTE 4,"The engine limits, center of gravity limits, and maximum weight limits shown under Section I, as 
 well as the performance limitations shown in the FAA Approved Flight Manual, are applicable 
 when the fuel grade associated with a particular limit or set of limits is used exclusively in all tanks. 
 When fuel grades are mixed or interchanged, the following shall apply: 
 A. 
 Fuel grades 108/135 and/or 115/145 may be used interchangeably or mixed in the same tank. 
 B. 
 When fuel of grade 100/130 is mixed with grades 115/145 and/or 108/135 in any tank, the engine 
 and performance limitations applicable to the airplane for 100/130 grade fuel shall apply. 
 C. 
 If the center section tank is filled with any proportion of 100/130 grade fuel, and the wing tanks 
 contain 115/145 and/or 108/135 grade fuel, the engine and performance limitations applicable to 
 the airplane for 100/130 grade fuel shall apply when fuel is used from the center tank. This will 
 permit takeoff and climb on the higher grade fuel and enroute operation on the 100/130 grade fuel."
NOTE 5,"When operating in the transport category, the aircraft must be operated in accordance with the FAA 
 Approved Flight Manual."
NOTE 6,"Operation in the restricted category is certified for the special purpose of mineral exploration, 
 agriculture, forest and wildlife conservation, and carriage of cargo. 
 For operation in the restricted category, the airspeed static source must be relocated as originally 
 installed on the Boeing KC-97G aircraft, described in USAF T.O. 1C-97 (K) E (C) -2-9. 
 When operating in restricted category, the following maximum restricted operating weights are 
 permitted. With respect to this action, the aircraft have demonstrated satisfactory operation and 
 the aircraft is eligible for operation in the transport category after having been operated at the 
 operating weights applicable to the restricted category. 
 Maximum Takeoff Gross Weight 
 = 153,000 lbs. 
 Landing Weight (10 FPS Sink Speed) 
 = 130,000 lbs. 
 Maximum Zero Fuel Weight 
 = 128,000 lbs. 
 See KC-97G Flight Manual T.O. 1C-97G-1 for Fuel Loading Distribution and Limitations. 
 When operating in restricted category, the aircraft must be operated in accordance with the KC-97G 
 Flight Manual T.O. 1C-97G-1, including the Hawkins & Powers FAA Approved Supplement to 
 T.O. 1C-97G-1. 
 When the aircraft is returned to the transport category, the required equipment specified in 
 Hawkins & Powers Aviation, Inc. Document HPA-97-101, dated 24 September 1982 or later

 FAA representative must be conducted in accordance with Hawkins & Powers, Inc. FAA approved 
 Inspection Guide, dated 25 Feruary 1981, or later FAA approved revisions."
NOTE 7,"Each time the aircraft is converted from one category to another, a log book entry signed by the
