 (a) CAA (FAA) Approved Airplane Flight Manual, Piper Model PA-14, dated",
Nos 14490 and up,"(b) Skiplane Supplement to Manual as follows: 
 Performance Information with Ski Installation. 
 Climb: Skiplane climb performance is essentially equal to that of the landplane. 
 Take-off and landing: Under the most favorable conditions of smooth packed 
 snow at temperature approximating 30°F, skiplane take-off distance is 
 essentially equal to the landplane distance. Landing distance is 
 approximately 20% greater than the landplane distance. In 
 applying the performance data, caution should be exercised in that lower 
 temperatures or other snow conditions will increase the ski friction and 
 hence increase the take-off run and decrease the landing run. 
 (c) When the Item 2, 3, 4 or 5 propeller is installed, the Airplane Flight Manual 
 should be revised to reflect this installation under ""Limitations"" section and under 
 ""Performance"" section, the following statement shall be added following Item 4 of 
 the section: ""5. Performance with the model _______ propeller has been 
 demonstrated to equal or exceed that presented herein over the altitude and 
 temperature range shown."""
