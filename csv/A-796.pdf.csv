EQUIPMENT,"A plus (+) or minus (-) sign preceding the weight of an optional item indicates the net weight change 
 between that item and the equivalent required item. 
 Approval for the installation of all items of equipment listed herein has been obtained by the aircraft 
 manufacturer except those items preceded by an asterisk (*). The asterisk denotes that approval has been 
 obtained by someone other than the aircraft manufacturer. An item marked with an asterisk may not have 
 been manufactured under an FAA monitored or approved quality control system; and, therefore, conformity 
 must be determined if the item is not identified by a Form ACA-186, PMA, or other evidence of FAA 
 production approval."

c,"FAA Approved Skiplane Supplement to Airplane Flight Manual dated January 25, 1949. In 
 lieu of this item, the following skiplane performance information may be appended to the 
 Performance Section of Item 401(a): 
 TAKEOFF DISTANCE AND LANDING DISTANCE - Under the most favorable conditions 
 of smooth packed snow at temperatures approximating 32°F, the skiplane takeoff distance 
 is approximately 10% greater than that shown for the landplane and the skiplane landing 
 distance is approximately 20% greater than that shown for the landplane. In estimating 
 takeoff and landing distance for other conditions, caution should be exercised in that lower 
 temperatures or other snow conditions will usually increase the takeoff distances and either 
 decrease or increase the landing distances. 
 NORMAL RATE OF CLIMB - Reduce rate of climb values of landplane by approximately 10%. 
 STALLING SPEED (POWER OFF) - Stalling speeds for skiplane same as shown for landplane."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated weight 
 empty, and loading instructions when necessary, must be in each aircraft at the time of 
 original certification and at all times thereafter (except in the case of air carrier operators 
 having an aproved weight control system)."
NOTE 2,"The following placards must be displayed in front of and in clear view of the pilot: 
 (a) 
 ""This airplane must be operated as a normal or utility category airplane in compliance with 
 the limitation in the FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual. All markings and placards on 
 this airplane apply to its operation as normal category airplane. For utility category operations, 
 refer to Airplane Flight Manual. No aerobatics maneuvers (including spins) are approved for 
 Normal Category operations."" 
 (b) ""Auxiliary Fuel Tank - Drain in level flight when main tank is half full. Close valve when 
 drained."""
