 The Swedish Certificate of Airworthiness for Export endorsed as noted under “Import 
 Requirements” must be submitted for each individual airplane for which application 
 for certification is made."
Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an Export Certificate of 
 Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the Swedish Civil 
 Aviation Administration. The Export C of A should contain the following 
 statement: ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and 
 found to conform with the Type Design approved under U.S. Type Certificate No. 
 A52EU and to be in a condition for safe operation. Compliance with Airworthiness 
 Directives (ADs) has been checked only for ADs issued by EASA, ADs adopted by 
 EASA and ADs published by FAA. 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR 
 Section 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR Sections 21.183 (c) 
 or 21.185 (c). 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR 
 Section 21.29 exported from countries other than the country of manufacture (e.g., 
 third party country) is FAR Sections 21.183 (d) or 21.183 (b). 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness 
 (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification 
 of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported 
 aircraft.”"
