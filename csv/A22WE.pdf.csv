 (b) The airplane must be loaded so that the C.G. is within specified limits at all times, considering fuel 
 loading and usage, gear retraction, and movement of crew and passengers from their assigned positions. 
 The lateral loading limits contained in the weight and balance document listed above should not be 
 exceeded. 
 (c) The weight of system fuel and oil, as defined below and hydraulic fluid, all of which must be included in 
 the airplane empty weight, is listed in Douglas Master Weight and Balance Manual or Military Tech. 
 Order specified in paragraph (a) above, for each airplane. 
 System Fuel: 
 The weight of all fuel required to fill all lines and tanks up to the zero fuel point on the fuel gages in the most 
 critical flight attitude. This includes the unusable tank fuel as defined by FAR Part 25.959. The DC-10-10, 
 DC-10-10F, DC-10-15, DC-10-30, DC-10-30F, MD-11, MD-11F, MD-10-10F and MD-10-30F have 609 
 pounds and the DC-10-40 and DC-10-40F have 622 pounds (based on 6.7 lb./gal fuel) of usable fuel in the 
 cross feed manifold lines, manifolds, and engine that is not part of the system fuel and must be included in 
 the total usable fuel to obtain correct weight and C.G. for takeoff. (See FAA Approved AFM for approved 
 procedures.) 
 System Oil: 
 The weight of oil remaining in the engine, constant speed drive, lines and tanks after subtracting the oil in the 
 tanks which is above the standpipe (zero gage) levels. The engine oil tank capacities shown elsewhere in this 
 data sheet include only the usable oil for which the tanks must be placarded. 
 (d) The ""Unusable” fuel is that amount of fuel in the tanks which is unavailable to the engines under critical 
 flight conditions as defined in FAR Part 25.959. See Weight and Balance Manual for ""Unusable” fuel. 
 This ""Unusable"" fuel is included in System Fuel as indicated in 1(c) above and need not be accounted 
 for separately. 
 (e) Fuel capacities shown in Sections I and II as well as fuel loading and usage procedures are dictated by 
 structural design and to maintain airplane C.G. within approved limits. Fuel must be loaded 
 symmetrically about the airplane centerline and in accordance with the following procedures and used as 
 described below unless alternate procedures are approved and incorporated in the FAA Approved 
 Airplane Flight Manual. The fuel system contains automatic transfer and quantity control features, 
 which will permit main tank-to-engine utilization of all fuel without manual control. During engine-out 
 conditions, symmetrical fuel distribution must be maintained by cross feed or transfer of fuel to the 
 tanks being used. 
 Fuel Loading - All Model MD-11, all Model MD-10 and all Model DC-10 (including DC-10-30F(KDC-10)) 
 airplanes except DC-10-30F (KC-10A) 
 Fill all main tanks equally until No. 1 and No. 3 tanks are full. Add additional fuel to No. 2 tank until full. 
 Load remainder into center wing auxiliary fuel tank, if installed on DC-10 or MD-10. 
 MD-11 only: After filling of center wing aux tank, load remainder of fuel into the horizontal tail fuel tank. 
 Fuel Loading - (DC-10-30F (KC-10A)) 
 Load fuel per T.O. 1C-10 (K) A-5, Chg. 1, dated 15 March 1981. 
 Fuel Usage - All Model MD-11, all Model MD-10 and all Model DC-10 airplanes, except KC-10A and 
 KDC-10: 
 Each main tank feeds its respective engine. Additional fuel added to the lower center wing auxiliary fuel 
 tank, if installed, and the upper center wing auxiliary fuel tank, if installed, is transferred to the three main 
 tanks numbers 1, 2, and 3. Simultaneously as the upper auxiliary tank fuel is used, fuel is transferred to it 
 from the lower auxiliary tank until the lower auxiliary is depleted and the transfer of the fuel from the upper 
 auxiliary tank is continued until it is empty. Fuel transfer is then initiated from No. 2 main tank to main tanks 
 No. 1 and 3 until fuel in all main tanks is equal. Then use fuel equally from each fuel tank. 
 Fuel Usage - KC-10A Only: 
 Fuel offloading is accomplished using fuel from the forward and aft fuselage fuel tanks, the center wing tanks 
 and the main tanks as required. When off loading is complete, if the C.G. of the airplane, less usable fuel, is 
 aft of 23.8 percent MAC, 15,000 pounds of fuel must remain in the forward fuel tank until the main fuel 
 tanks are depleted to 5,000 pounds each. The 15,000 pounds in the forward fuselage fuel tanks may then be 
 transferred equally to the main fuel tanks or off loaded. 
 Fuel Usage - KDC-10 Only: 
 Fuel off loading is accomplished using fuel from the center wing tanks and the main tanks as required. When 
 off loading is complete, transfer center wing fuel to the three main tanks until the center wing tank is empty. 
 Transfer the excess fuel from the No. 2 main tank to main tanks No. 1 and No. 3 until fuel in all main tanks is 
 equal. Then use fuel equally from each fuel tank. 
 (f) Fuel Dump 
 Refer to FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual for limitations to be observed during fuel dumping. The 
 total undumpable fuel remaining in the fuel tanks after dumping is as follows for fuel weight based on 6.7 lb. 
 /gal. fuel:
