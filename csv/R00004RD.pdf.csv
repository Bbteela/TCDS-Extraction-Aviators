 the English language): 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the 
 United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to 
 identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of 
 airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions 
 to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to FAA 
 Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of 
 an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft.

 Kit Full Ice Protection System P/N 8G3000F00111 with DGCU 
 P/N 8G2420V00351 (see RFM Supplement 44 or 49, according to 
 the relevant aircraft configuration) 
 The aircraft configuration approved for use in full icing condition is described 
 in the Report 189G3000A001”AW189 Icing Compatibility Reference

 Refer to Rotorcraft Flight Manual and related supplements for other approved 
 mandatory and optional equipment. 
 Refer to Kit Compatibility Handbook 189G0000A002 for incompatibilities and 
 restrictions between optional equipment.

 Chapter 4 and must be replaced accordingly."
NOTE 4,"The model AW189 rotorcraft employs electronic engine controls, commonly named Full authority Digital Engine 
 Controls (FADEC), that are recognized to be more susceptible to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) than rotorcraft 
 that have non-electronic controls. (EMI may be the result of radiated or conducted interference.) For this reason 
 modifications that add or change systems that have the potential for EMI, must either be qualified to a standard 
 acceptable to the FAA or tested at the time of installation for interference with the FADEC. This type of testing must 
 employ the particular FADEC diagnostic techniques and external diagnostic techniques. The test procedure must be 
 FAA approved."
NOTE 5,"The FAA Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) is identical to the EASA approved RFM; any exceptions unique for FAA 
 are presented on yellow pages marked “EASA approved on behalf of FAA” or “FAA Approved”. They must be

NOTE 6,"The Leonarod S.p.a. Model AW189 incorporates an integrated avionics system using software-based line replaceable 
 units (LRU) which share a digital signal transmission bus. The software configuration of the AW189, as delivered 
 from production, is critical to the proper operation of the avionics and cockpit instrumentation system. Modification 
 to the LRU software supplied with the AW189, replacement of an LRU with a different LRU, addition of new LRU, 
 or alteration of an LRU interface could adversely affect the airworthiness of the certified software. No changes to the 
 integrated avionics system should be made without coordination with the FAA Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) 
 having jurisdiction over the modifier."
NOTE 7,"The hydraulic fluids must conform to MIL-PRF-83282 or MIL-PRF-5606 which is an alternate for low Temperature 
 operation - see LIMITATIONS Section of the approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual."
NOTE 8,"Any changes to the type design of this helicopter by means of a amended type certificate (TC), supplemental type 
 certificate (STC), or amended STC, requiring instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA's) must be submitted thru 
 the project aircraft certification office (ACO) for review and acceptance by the Fort Worth -Aircraft Evaluation Group 
 (FTW-AEG) Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) prior to the aircraft delivery, or upon issuance of the first 
 standard airworthiness certificate for the affected aircraft, whichever occurs later as prescribed by Title 14 CFR 21.50. 
 Type design changes by means of a field approval that require ICA's must have those ICA's reviewed by the field 
 approving FSDO."
