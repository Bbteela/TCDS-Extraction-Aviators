 NOTE 1. (a) Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated weight empty, and loading 
 instructions, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter (except in the 
 case of air carrier operators having an approved weight control system). Manufacturer's Master Equipment List 
 contains list of approved equipment in addition to equipment listed in this specification. 
 (b) ""System Fuel and Oil"" (Item 103), which must be included in the empty weight, is that amount required to fill 
 both systems and the tanks up to the tank outlets to the engines, when the airplane is in the level attitude. The 
 propeller feathering oil in aircraft incorporating Hamilton Standard propellers is not considered usable oil and is 
 included in the ""System Oil"". The nacelle oil tank capacities shown in this specification include only the usable 
 oil for which the tanks are to be placarded. All hydraulic system fluid (See Item 608) must also be included in 
 the empty weight of the airplane. 
 (c) The ""unusable fuel"" is that amount of fuel in the tanks which is unavailable to the engines under critical flight 
 conditions as defined in CAR 4b,.416 and may be obtained by taking the difference between the ""total"" and 
 ""usable"" tank capacities shown under ""Fuel Capacity."" The ""unusable fuel"" must either be included in the 
 airplane empty weight or be suitably accounted for in the airplane weight and balance report. 
 (d) Structural Limitations on Fuel Loading and Usage. All fuel must be distributed equally on both sides of the 
 airplane. All main tanks must be filled equally first, then alternates, then auxiliaries (ten wing tank airplanes). 
 Fuel must be used in the reverse order from fuel loading except for take-off, climb and landing, at which time 
 the main tanks must be used. Satisfactory alternate fuel loading and usage procedures have been approved and 
 placed in the Approved Airplane Flight Manual. These alternate procedures may be used in lieu of the above. 
 (e) Fuel dumping. Fuel dump valves (Item 102) must be installed for operation of the airplane at weights in excess 
 of maximum landing weight. Refer to FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual for limitations and cautionary 
 procedures to be observed during the dumping of fuel. When dump system (Item 102) is installed, the amount 
 of usable fuel remaining in the fuel tanks after dumping is as follows:

 The total undumpable fuel, oil and ADI fluid must be included in the landing weight. In some cases the amount of 
 undumpable fuel, oil and ADI fluid is greater than the difference between the maximum ""Zero Fuel, Oil and ADI 
 Fluid"" gross weight and the maximum landing weight. When such is the case, the ""Zero Fuel, Oil and ADI Fluid"" 
 gross weight used in loading the airplane must be reduced by an amount sufficient to insure that the maximum 
 landing weight will not be exceeded after fuel is dumped. 
 (f) When the oil transfer tank is installed in the wing fillet, the weight of oil carried in that tank plus the system oil 
 (Item 103(d)) must be included in the Zero Fuel, Oil and ADI Fluid gross weight. 
 (g) For the interior arrangement of a particular airplane, see approved Douglas Report SM-13912, ""Loading Chart 
 and Actual Weight and Balance."" That report shows the location of all passenger and crew member seats; 
 location and capacity of all cargo and baggage compartments, buffets, storage spaces, and coat-rooms; and 
 location and capacity of lounges and lavatories for each of the different sleeper and day-plane arrangements 
 covered by the above mentional report. Lounges, lavatories, and baggage or cargo compartments must be 
 placarded for the capacities specified in the above report. The airplane must always be loaded within the C.G. 
 limits shown in this specification, accounting for crew and passenger movement and use of fuel, oil, and ADI 
 fluid. 
 NOTE 2. The following placard shall be placed on the instrument panel in full view of the pilot: 
 (a) ""This airplane shall be operated in compliance with the operating limitations specified in the FAA Approved 
 Airplane Flight Manual."" 
 NOTE 3. When water-alcohol injection is not used for take-off on aircraft equipped with P&W Double Wasp CB-16 engines, 
 Item 101(a) or P&W Wasp CB-3 engines, Item 101(i), the propeller governors must be reset prior to take-off in 
 order to limit the dry take-off engine rpm to 2700. 
 FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual, pertinent appendices, and existing instructions.

 NOTE 5. This airplane has been found to comply with the standards for Category A of Annex 8 to the Convention on 
 International Civil Aviation, entitled ""Airworthiness of Aircraft"" as amended to March 1951, with the following 
 exceptions 
 (a) Chapter 7 Sub-Part 7.2.5.3 Paragraph 4, unless oil filler screens per Douglas Dwg. 5344416, change ""BD"" are 
 incorporated. 
 4406020 are incorporated. 
 (c) Chapter 9 Sub-Part 9.3 ""Aeroplane Flight Manual,"" unless Airplane Flight Manual amended to include Section 
 VI ICAO Requirements. 
 (d) Chapter 2 Sub-Part 2.4.4 ""Stalling, Symmetrical Power,"" unless wing spoilers are installed. 
 NOTE 6: The following table lists the maximum zero fuel, oil and ADI fluid, landing and take-off weights of the various 8 and 
 10 wing fuel tank aircraft as they are limited by structural strength. Although an aircraft may be eligible, from a 
 structural standpoint, for certain take-off weights, the take-off weight may be limited from a performance standpoint 
 due to the propeller and engine combination that is installed, the flap setting used and whether water-alcohol 
 injection is used to increase the take-off power. Therefore, the table of take-off weights under maximum weights 
 should also be adhered to in determining the maximum permissible take-off weight of various aircraft.
