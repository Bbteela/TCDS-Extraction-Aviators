NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated weight empty, and loading 
 instructions when necessary, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter 
 (except in the case of air carrier operators having an approved weight control system)."
NOTE 2,"(a) 
 In order to be eligible for night operation, any UC-61 series airplane having uncertificated position lights should 
 have them replaced with approved types. If Air Force type A-9 wing-tip lights are installed, they may be used 
 provided the sandblasted surface on the inside of the cover glass is painted black. 
 (b) Some Army UC-61 aircraft were equipped with Warner 165 series engines instead of Warner 145 hp engines. 
 Any UC-61 aircraft equipped with the higher hp engine should be certificated as model 24W-41A. 
 (c) 
 Military engine model R-500-1 is identical to model 165. Military engine model R-500-7 is similar to model R- 
 500-1 except that it incorporates heavier pistons, 1-49/16 in. carburetor venturi (Holley), and shielded ignition 
 with weight (dry) of 351 lbs. Prior to use of any engine of these models in certificated aircraft, the generator drive 
 gear, part No. 7859 should be removed and magnetically inspected for cracks. The Champion E-2411 generator 
 used on these engines in military aircraft should not be reinstalled in these engines or in any other Warner 165 
 series engine. Drive gear failures have been experienced when using this generator which does not incorporate a 
 flexible torsion drive. The designation plate of a military engine used in certificated aircraft should be stamped 
 with the corresponding certificated engine model designation and the Type Certificate No. If there is no room for 
 this information on the existing plate, such information may be stamped on a plain thin metal plate and attached 
 beneath the existing plate by at least two of the mounting screws."
NOTE 3,"Eligible with Kinner R-56 engine when converted by means of Kinner Installation Kit. The application for approval 
 must be accompanied by an affidavit to the effect that the alteration has been accomplished in exact accordance with 
 the approved drawings and instructions, and that parts and materials furnished in the Kit have been used. Weight and 
 balance should be checked after the alteration to determine that forward C.G. limit of the aircraft has not been 
 exceeded. Upon approval of the alteration, the aircraft model designation should be modified by suffixing the letter 
 ""K"", e.g. model 24W-9 should be changed to model 24W-9K."
