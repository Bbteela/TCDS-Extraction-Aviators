 Certificate of Airworthiness for Export when all of the following conditions have been atisfied: 
 (a) Aircraft records must indicate, or a determination must be made, that the aircraft has been subjected to FAA 
 initial 
 screening inspection. The screening inspection record must show that the aircraft has a reasonable potential for 
 standard certification. (Those aircraft dispositioned as having no reasonable potential for standard certification 
 are not certifiable. These aircraft are sold by U.S.Department of Defense only for the purpose of ""Recovery of 
 Parts or Reduction to Scrap"".) 
 (b) The aircraft must be converted to Bombardier Model DHC-3 in accordance with Bombardier Modification SOO- 
 3028, Issue 6, and Bombardier Service Bulletin 3/21, Original Issue.

 operation. 
 (d) A satisfactory ""100 hour"" type inspection has been accomplished and recorded. 
 (e) Any deviations to the type design must be appropriately approved by an FAA Supplemental Type Certificate or 
 other methods acceptable to the FAA. 
 Upon satisfying all the foregoing conditions, and when all other pertinent U.S. regulatory requirements have been 
 met, a U.S. Standard Airworthiness Certificate may be issued. (Certification basis is FAR 21.183(c) since these 
 are import aircraft.) 
 Technical data needed for conversion purposes are available to the applicant through Bombardier of Canada Limited. 
 Inquiries for this data should be submitted to The Product Support Department, Bombardier of Canada, Limited,
