NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and 
 loading instructions when necessary, must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original certification. 
 The C.G. limits were determined with the landing gear extended. The airplane must always be so loaded that 
 its C.G. position with the landing gear extended is between the limits shown."
NOTE 2,"The following placards must be displayed as indicated: 
 (a) Lavatory door: ""This room not to be occupied during takeoff and landing."" 
 (b) Instrument panel in full view of the pilot: 
 (1) ""This airplane shall be operated in accordance with Part I of the FAA Approved Operating 
 Manual for the Beech C18S airplane. This manual shall be carried in the pilot's compartment 
 at all times."" (Used with standard aircraft). 
 (2) ""Acrobatics and intentional spinning prohibited."" 
 (3) ""This airplane must be operated as a normal category airplane in compliance with the Airplane 
 Flight Manual. No acrobatic maneuvers including spins approved."" (Used when aircraft is 
 modernized per item 601 and 602). 
 (c) On airplanes with nose baggage provisions on inner side of nose door: ""Load in accordance with 
 Airplane Flight Manual. Max. structural capacity of nose 600 lb."""
NOTE 3,"Prior to certification as a civil aircraft, the following must be accomplished: 
 (a) Each airplane must be weighed to determine its weight and balance unless a satisfactory Army or 
 Navy weight and balance report is available. An approved loading chart or device must be 
 installed. 
 (b) The fuel cross-feed system must either be removed or disconnected from the fuel system, or the 
 pressure cross-feed valve enclosed in a fuel and fume-tight box which is ventilated and drained to 
 the outside. (Beech Service Bulletin C18-3 outlines a satisfactory method of accomplishing this 
 modification). 
 (c) Each fuel and oil tank and/or the structure adjacent to the filler opening must be placarded for the 
 contents and capacity. 
 (d) A satisfactory means of measuring the oil must be provided. 
 (e) Instruments must be marked for approved operation limitations as outlined in CAM 04.4632. 
 (f) A master switch arrangement (accessible to the pilot or copilot) must be installed in order that all 
 electrical power, including batteries and generators, can be disconnected within approximately two 
 feet of the power source with one operation. 
 (g) All fuses and circuit breakers for required equipment, including radio fuse, must be accessible to 
 the crew for replacement or resetting in flight. 
 (h) All airplanes except C-45 and C-45A (JRB-2) must have control system lock removed. 
 (i) 
 The navigator’s turret must be removed and a suitable enclosure installed. 
 (j) 
 When engines as described by item 109(e) through (j) are installed, the engine nameplate must 
 have the following information added: ""FAA Specification No. 5E1"". 
 (k) If the landing lights are retained, the circuit must be revised to provide adequate circuit protection 
 in the motor circuit. The installation of an additional fuse (15 a.) in the motor circuit is 
 satisfactory. 
 (l) 
 Circuit breakers or fuses must be installed in the generator main line circuits (applies only to C- 
 45B, C-45F, AT-7C, SNB-2C, JRB-3 and JRB-4 aircraft). 
 (m) The 38 gal. nose fuel tank may be installed or retained in the military models provided a 
 satisfactory drain and fuel gauge is installed in the lower tank and a finger strainer of approximately 
 10 mesh is installed in the fuel tank outlet. 
 (n) For certification for ""Night Flying"", the following must be complied with: 
 (1) Remove the resistors installed in the position light circuits and replace the single pole double 
 throw position light switch with a single pole single throw switch. 
 (2) Replace the wing position lights with certificated units, or satisfactorily modify the lights, if 
 pertinent. Nose: Type A-9 wing position lights (AN-3033-5 through -8) may be satisfactorily 
 modified by painting the inside of the frosted glass cover black. Type A-9 (AN-3033-1 
 through -4) are satisfactory without modification. 
 (3) The tail light must be replaced with a certificated unit. 
 (4) The amber glass of the tail warning light must be replaced with a clear cover glass; otherwise, 
 this light must be made inoperative. 
 (o) If the engines do not incorporate an .010 in. radius at the root of the crankshaft thrust bearing nut 
 threads as outlined in P&W Service Bulletin No. 1488, the dye penetrant inspection of the subject 
 area described under ""Note"" in AD 57-5-4 must be accomplished even though no oil leakage of the 
 front section is noted. 
 (p) Install wing spar strap which reinforces the lower spar cap from LWS 181 to RWS 181. Consult 
 STC Summary or applicable AD's for eligible installation. 
 Upon completion of the conversion to certificated status, the manufacturer's nameplate containing 
 the commercial model designation, serial number and the date of manufacture shall be installed 
 below the original nameplate. The original or any succeeding nameplate should not be removed 
 from the aircraft."
