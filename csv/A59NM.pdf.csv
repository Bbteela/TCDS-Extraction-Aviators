 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 21.29 and exported by the 
 country of manufacture is FAR Sections 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 21.29 exported from 
 countries other than the country of manufacture (e.g. third party country) is FAR 21.183(d) or 21.185(b). 
 Notwithstanding that the FAR referenced in the above paragraph does not specifically address or require a foreign 
 civil airworthiness authority certification, such certification is the only practical way for an applicant to show, and 
 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to find conformity to the FAA-approved type design and conditions for"
safe operation,"Engines, Propellers, and Related Products Imported into the United States."

 Dassault document DGT131264 identifies the complete agreed upon 
 certification basis for the F7X M1000 project 
 The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) originally type certificated this 
 aircraft under its type certificate Number A.155. The FAA validated this product 
 under U.S. Type Certificate Number A59NM issued April 27, 2007. 
 Type Definition 
 The type definition is defined by F7TC which is stored in an electronic format 
 under the virtual product management tool ENOVIA/VPM©. The repository of 
 the ENOVIA/VPM© database is located in Dassault Aviation facilities. 
 (See note 5) 
 Equipment 
 The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (see certification basis) must be installed on the aircraft for 
 certification. The lists of all equipment as well as optional equipment approved 
 by European Aircraft Safety Agency (EASA) are contained in the F7TC version 
 stored in an electronic format under the virtual product management tool 
 ENOVIA/VPM©. 
 In addition, the aircraft must be operated in accordance with the FAA approved 
 FALCON 7X Airplane Flight Manual, document DGT 105608. 
 Service Information 
 Each of the documents listed below that contain a statement that it is approved 
 by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) are accepted by the FAA and 
 are considered FAA approved. 
 • Dassault Aviation Service Bulletins, except as noted below, 
 • Structural repair manuals, 
 • Vendor manuals referenced in Dassault Aviation service bulletins 
 • Aircraft flight manuals, 
 • Repair Instructions. 
 Additionally, approvals issued by Dassault Aviation under the authority of 
 EASA approved Design Organization DOA EASA.21J.051 are considered FAA 
 approved. These approvals pertain to the type certificate only such as changes to 
 type design, repair/unrepair of damages. 
 Note: Design changes that are contained in Dassault Aviation Service Bulletins 
 and that are classified as Level 1 Major in accordance with US/France Bilateral 
 Aviation Safety Agreement Implementation Procedures for Airworthiness must 
 be approved by the FAA. 
 FALCON 7X Operating and Service Instructions 
 The aircraft must be operated according to the EASA approved Airplane Flight 
 Manual DGT 105608 for the basic Falcon 7X. The aircraft must be operated 
 according to the EASA approved Airplane Flight Manual DGT 147681 for the 
 Falcon 7X M1000 airplanes (Falcon 8X).

 NOTES 
 NOTE 1 - Weight and Balance 
 (a) - A current weight and balance report must be carried in the aircraft at all times from the moment the 
 aircraft is originally certified. 
 (b) - Loading of the aircraft must be accomplished in a manner that always maintains the center of gravity 
 within the specified limits considering crew and passenger movements as well as fuel consumption and 
 transfer. 
 NOTE 2 - Cabin interior and seating configuration must be approved. 
 NOTE 3 - Service Life Limits and required Maintenance/Inspections 
 (a) 
 Airframe components which are life limited, and associated retirement times, are presented in chapter 
 5.40.00 of the FALCON 7X Maintenance Manual, approved by EASA, and must be replaced as 
 indicated therein.
