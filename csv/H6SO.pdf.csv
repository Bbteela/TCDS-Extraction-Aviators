Basis,"Models SW205, SW204HP and SW204. 
 FAR21.25(a)(1)effective January 6, 1975, for Southwest Florida Aviation 
 Model SW205A-1. 
 Type Certificate H6SO issued April 17, 1989, for the purpose of: 
 1) Agricultural Operations under FAR 21.25(b)(1). 
 Note: In accordance with FAR 36.1(a)(4), compliance with noise 
 requirements was not shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this type 
 certficate are only eligible for agricultural operations excepted by FAR 
 36.1(a)(4) and defined under FAR 137.3. 
 2) Forest and Wildlife Conservation Operations under FAR 21.25(b)(2). 
 Note: In accordance with FAR 36.1(a)(4), compliance with noise 
 requirements was not shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this type 
 certficate are only eligible for dispensing firefighting materials excepted by 
 FAR 36.1(a)(4) and defined under FAR 137.3. 
 3) External Load Operations under FAR 21.25(b)(7). 
 Note: In accordance with FAR 36.1(a)(4), compliance with noise 
 requirements was not shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this type 
 certficate are only eligible for external load operations excepted by FAR 
 36.1(a)(4) and defined under FAR 133.1(b). 
 Any alteration to the aircraft for Special Purposes not identified above require 
 further FAA approval and in addition may require noise and/or flight testing. 
 General Note: Any subsequent modifications to the helicopters type certified 
 under this Type Certificate are to have the certification basis for that modification 
 established under 14 CFR 21.101 published June 7, 2000 which became effective 
 June 10, 2003. Otherwise non-significant modifications are to meet the 
 requirements of 14 CFR 29 airworthiness standards, transport category, 
 Amendment 1, effective August 12, 1965 and 14 CFR 29.1529, 
 Instructions for Continued Airworthiness, Amendment 20, effective September 11, 
 1980."
Production Basis,"None. No helicopter may be manufactured under this approval. Prior to adding serial 
 numbers to this Type Certificate, each candidate helicopter must undergo a conformity 
 inspection. The conformity inspection will be conducted in accordance with a Type 
 Inspection Authorization, Part 1, or request for conformity that will include as a 
 minimum, the inspections contained in the FAA Rotorcraft Directorate Restricted 
 Category conformity document dated September 25, 2001 or later FAA approved 
 revision."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (See Certification Basis) must be installed in the rotorcraft for 
 certification. In addition the following items or equipment are required with each 
 rotorcraft as specified: 
 (a) Outside air temperature gauge 
 (b) Engine tail pipe temperature gauge 
 (c) The applicable rotorcraft operator's manual or flight manual as revised 
 (See Note 4). 
 (d) For the Model SW204HP (UH-1B, as modified with alternate engine), 
 FAA approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual Supplement dated January 19, 1994,

 (g) For the Model SW205A-1, FAA approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual 
 Supplement dated June 9, 1996, or later FAA approved revision, is required."
NOTE 1,"A current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in the certificated empty 
 weight, and loading instructions when necessary, must be provided for each rotorcraft at the time of 
 original certification. For C.G. determination and use of ballast, if required, refer to the 
 applicable operator's manual, or flight manual, and maintenance manual (See Note 4 for manual 
 listing). 
 Model SW205 (UH-1H): The certificated empty weight and corresponding C.G. locations must include
