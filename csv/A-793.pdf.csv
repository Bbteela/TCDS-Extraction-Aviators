NOTE 5,"All aircraft have been modified to include provisions of CVAC Service Bulletin No. 240- 
 22A, Bendix Bulletin No. L.G. 500, and Equipment Item 202.(b). Weight and C.G. 
 Range Limitations previously listed under NOTE 5 are now shown under the 
 corresponding limitations of Section II. 
 For operation of the airplane at altitude airports, incorporation of Equipment Item 209.(a) 
 may be necessary. Consult FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual for determination of 
 specific requirements. With airplanes incorporating Item 207.(b), prerotation type tires 
 are not required."
NOTE 6,"Model 240 aircraft are presently approved for operation in ""light icing"" conditions when 
 either Equipment Items 116.(a) or (b) are installed (provided Equipment Item 506.(a), 
 (b), or (c), and other pertinent anti-icing equipment are installed) under the following 
 provision: 
 (a) 
 Deleted July 15, 1963. 
 (b) 
 When Equipment Item 116.(b) is installed, the airplane, to be eligible for operation 
 into ""light icing"" conditions, must incorporate Convair Service Bulletins 240-21, 
 240-143, 240-200, and Convair Service Information Letter 389. Convair Service 
 Bulletin 240-21 covers incorporation of the muff type augmenters and other 
 miscellaneous changes. Service Bulletin 240-143 specifies incorporation of 
 stainless steel augmenter troughs. Service Bulletin 240-200 incorporates the 
 installation of thermo-override switches in the heater ducts adjacent to the 
 augmenter tubes. Service Information Letter 389 requires the relocation of the wing 
 anti-icing temperature pick-up bulbs to the respective wing tips. Service Bulletin 
 240-143 need not be incorporated on aircraft incorporating the long augmenter 
 stacks which extend to a position at least flush with the end of the engine nacelle. 
 Before aircraft revised in accordance with the above technical data can be operated 
 under the terms of this icing approval, it will be necessary that a flight check be 
 accomplished to determine that the revised anti-icing installation meets the 
 following minimum standard: With the airplane operating in level flight, two 
 engine, 1000 horsepower per engine at 10,000 feet augmenter vanes in trail position, 
 at least the following minimum temperatures above outside air temperature must 
 appear on the pilot's instruments: 
 Wing tips 
 93°C. 
 Tail 
 100°C."
NOTE 7,"Ferry permits may be issued to Model 240 series aircraft on which the automatic 
 feathering system is inoperative. See FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual for 
 pertinent limitations."
NOTE 8,"The various dash numbers listed under Section I and II are actually versions of the basic 
 Model 240 series aircraft, the certification basis for which is Type Certificate No. A-793. 
 These dash numbers were selected by CVAC primarily for contractual and clerical 
 purposes and should not be considered to define different models of airplanes. Any one 
 version may be converted to another by incorporation of pertinent required equipment 
 and complete conformity with corresponding approved drawings. 
 It should be noted, however, that the identification plate in the cockpit indicates the 
 specific airplane version and that different FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manuals, 
 dependent primarily upon the propellers installed, are applicable to different groups of 
 versions. Accordingly, when any version of a 240 series aircraft is converted to another, 
 an additional identification plate should be installed adjacent to the manufacturer's plate. 
 It should include the name of the agency accomplishing the conversion, the date of the 
 conversion, and the new version number. It should be determined that the FAA 
 Approved Airplane Flight Manual pertinent to the new version is installed."
