Certification Basis,"FAR 21.29, FAR 29 effective 1 February 1965, including Amendments 29-1 
 through 29-26. 
 FAR Part 36 Noise Standards Amended by Amendments 36-1 through the latest 
 amendment in effect at the time of certification (Amdt. 36-15). 
 The applicant has shown compliance to FAR Part 29.923 for 2 -1/2 minute OEI 
 ratings. 
 The Polish Glowny Inspektorat Lotnictwa Cywilnego (General 
 Inspectorate of Civil Aviation) originally type certificated this rotorcraft 
 under its type certificate number BC 188. The FAA validated this 
 product under U.S. Type Certificate Number H15EU. Effective 
 September 28, 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) 
 began oversight of this product on behalf of the Polish Glowny 
 Inspektorat Lotnictwa Cywilnego (General Inspectorate of Civil 
 Aviation)."
Import Requirements,"To be eligible for operation in the United States, each aircraft manufactured 
 under this Type Certificate must be accompanied by a certificate of 
 airworthiness for export or certifying statement endorsed by the exporting civil 
 airworthiness authority which states (in the English language): ""This aircraft 
 conforms to its U.S. type design (Type Certificate Number H15EU) and is in a 
 condition for safe operation."" 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 
 FAR Section 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR Sections 
 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into 
 the United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the 
 agreement, to identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the 
 export certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures 
 for coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer 
 to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements 
 for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft. 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 
 FAR Section 21.29 exported from countries other than the country of 
 manufacture (e.g. third party country) is FAR Sections 21.183(d) or 21.183(b). 
 The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an National 
 Aviation Authority (NAA) Export Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) 
 signed by a representative of the Polish Glowny Inspektorat Lotnictwa 
 Cywilnego (General Inspectorate of Civil Aviation) on behalf of the European 
 Community. 
 The Export C of A should contain the following statement: “The aircraft 
 covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to comply with 
 the type design approved under U.S. Type Certificate Number H15EU and to be 
 in a condition for safe operation.”"
Service Information,"Service Bulletins, structural repair manuals, helicopter flight manuals, and 
 overhaul and maintenance manuals, which contain a statement that the 
 document is GILC approved, are accepted by the FAA and are considered 
 FAA approved. These approvals pertain to type design only. 
 Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the 
 European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before 
 September 28, 2003 – by the Polish Glowny Inspektorat Lotnictwa Cywilnego 
 (General Inspectorate of Civil Aviation). Any such documents are accepted by 
 the FAA and are considered FAA approved. 
  
 Service Bulletin, 
  
 Structural repair manuals, 
  
 Vendor manuals, 
  
 Aircraft flight manuals, and 
  
 Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 This applies only to the acceptance of the type design data"
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (See Certification Basis) must be installed in the helicopter for 
 certification. In addition, the following items of equipment are required with 
 each helicopter as specified: 
 FAA approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual, dated March 31, 1993 or later 
 revisions."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in the certificated empty weight 
 and loading instructions, when necessary, must be provided for each helicopter at the time of original 
 certification. 
 Weight empty - Total weight of structure, systems equipment and permanent fittings necessary to 
 complete every helicopter version, the weight empty includes weight of fluids in hydraulic system, 
 blade dampers and shock absorbers and extinguisher bottles as well as weight of engine and 
 transmission oil filled up to MAX level and unusable fuel."
NOTE 2,"The retirement times of certain parts are listed in Chapter 4 of the Model ""PZL W-3A Helicopter. 
 Instructions for Continued Airworthiness Maintenance Manual."" Those values of retirement or service 
 life cannot be increased without GILC Engineering Approval. In addition, information essential for 
 proper maintenance of the helicopter is contained in the ""PZL W-3A Helicopter. Instructions for 
 Continued Airworthiness Maintenance Manual."""
NOTE 3,"Model PZL W-3A helicopter incorporating IFR equiipment per requirements of PZL W-3A RFM 
 Section 1 is eligible for IFR operations. Minimum flight crew: 2 (pilot and co-pilot)."
