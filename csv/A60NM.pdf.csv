Serial Numbers,"No civil C-27J JCA customers are presently identified. Military configured C-27J JCA airplanes 
 could be eligible for a U.S. civil standard certificate of airworthiness (See “Import Requirements”) 
 if exported from Italy to the U.S. with an Export Certificate of Airworthiness that references the 
 FAA approved civil type design with identified deviations; these deviations must be rectified 
 before such airplanes will be eligible for a U.S. civil standard certificate of airworthiness."
Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an Export Certificate of Airworthiness 
 (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the ENAC on behalf of the European Community. 
 The Export C of A should contain the following statement: ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate 
 has been examined, tested, and found to conform with the Type Design approved under U.S. Type 
 Certificate No. A60NM and to be in a condition for safe operation.’"

 Continued Airworthiness and Safety Improvements 
 Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) Number 88, Amendment 21-78, became 
 effective June 6, 2001. SFAR No. 88, “Fuel Tank System Fault Tolerance Evaluation 
 Requirements”, is applicable to the C-27J JCA. Alenia Aeronautica must satisfy the 
 requirements of SFAR No. 88 within 18 months after issuance of the type certificate. 
 14 CFR Part 26, effective September 19, 2008, including Amendment 26-2. 
 Environmental Standards 
 14 CFR Part 36, effective December 1, 1969, including Amendments 36-1 through 
 36-28; 
 14 CFR Part 34, effective September 10, 1990, including Amendments 34-1 
 through 34-3. 
 Additional Design Requirements and Conditions 
 The following design details or information must be maintained to ensure that an unsafe 
 design condition is not present: 
 Severe Icing Conditions: Airplanes with pneumatic deicing boots and non-powered 
 lateral axis flight controls can be more susceptible to a potential loss of control following 
 an exposure to supercooled large drop icing conditions. Specific visual cues for 
 identifying severe icing conditions for the C-27J were determined, and the airplane was 
 shown to be controllable after such an encounter and capable of safely exiting these 
 conditions. The Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) Limitations (Section 2-5 “Systems” and 
 Section 2-7 “Icing Conditions”), Normal Procedures (Section 3-17 “Flight Conditions”) 
 and Emergency Procedures (Section 4A-12 “Miscellaneous”) contain instructions for 
 identifying severe icing conditions and procedures for safely exiting such conditions. 
 Reverse Thrust and Propeller Pitch Settings below the Flight Regime: The C-27J 
 includes a feature named “Beta Lock-Out System” to protect the intentional activation of 
 the Reverse Thrust and Propeller Pitch Settings below the Flight Regime in flight. This 
 Beta Lock-Out System is compliant with the requirements of EASA CS 25.1155 at 
 Amendment 5. The Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) Limitations (Section 2-4 “Power 
 Plant”), Emergency Procedures (Section 4A-2 “ACAWS” and Section 4A-3 “Engine”) 
 and Procedures Following Failures (Section 4B-2 “ACAWS” and Section 4B-20 
 “Avionics System”) contain instructions for operation during beta lock-out system 
 malfunctions. 
 Class E Cargo Compartment - Protection of essential systems: Cargo Compartment 
 Lining panels are installed in the cargo compartment in order to assure protection against 
 flame penetration for all essential systems and equipment. These panels meet the flame 
 penetration resistance requirements of Appendix F Part III of JAR-25 (Change 14 
 Amendment 25/96/1). The Cargo Compartment Lining consists of: 
  
 sidewall panels installed from frame 9 to frame 29; 
  
 ceiling panels installed from frame 9 to frame 32. 
 Following a smoke event, the flight crew will apply the relevant Airplane Flight Manual 
 (AFM) Emergency Procedures to shut-off cargo ventilation, depressurize the cabin to 
 24,000 feet and start emergency descent and landing as soon as possible (Section 4A-5 
 “Smoke”). 
 Fuel Tank Vent System Flame Arrestors: The fuel vent outlets of the Model C-27J 
 include flame arrestors to prevent fuel tank explosions following an accident. Flame 
 arrestors must be maintained that have flame holding capability for a minimum period of 
 2.5 minutes to allow passenger evacuation following an accident. The flame arrestor 
 installation must also be designed such that either ice will not accumulate during icing 
 conditions or the fuel tank pressures will be maintained within allowable limits by other 
 means when the arrestor installation ices over."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations (see the 
 Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft. As referenced in the paragraph 2.2 of Doc. ref. 
 G-CONF-110/090-0100-0002-AL Issue 14 “C-27J – Civil Certification – Type Design Definition”, 
 the lists of all equipment as well as optional approved equipment are contained in the document: 
 Doc. ref. G-CONF-110/090-0100-0016-AL Issue 1 “Equipment Qualification List”."

 by the FAA prior to delivery of the first airplane or issuance of a standard certificate of 
 airworthiness, whichever occurs later. Contact the TC issuing office, ANM-116, for information."
NOTE 5,"Other Operating Limitations: 
 - 
 The FAA pilot type rating has not been determined. No U.S. C-27J JCA pilot certificates may 
 be issued until this is accomplished. 
 -
