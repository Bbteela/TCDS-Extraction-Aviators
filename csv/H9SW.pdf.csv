 values of retirement of service lives and inspection cannot be increased without the 
 approval of Canadian DOT. 
 The retirement times of critical parts are listed in the following table. These limitations 
 may not be changed without FAA engineering approval. 
 MODEL 222/222B (Refer to FAA-approved Chapter 4 of the Maintenance Manual,

 BHT-430-MM-1, for airworthiness lives of components applicable to 430) 
 Bell Service Bulletins are approved by Transport Canada and include a statement 
 to that effect. Such approval may be approved by FAA. 
 Any changes to the type design of this helicopter by means of an amended type certificate 
 (TC), supplemental type certificate (STC), or amended STC, requiring instructions for 
 continued airworthiness (ICA's) must be submitted thru the project aircraft certification 
 office (ACO) for review and acceptance by the Fort Worth -Aircraft Evaluation Group 
 (FTW-AEG) Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) prior to the aircraft delivery, or 
 upon issuance of the first standard airworthiness certificate for the affected aircraft, 
 whichever occurs later as prescribed by Title 14 CFR 21.50. Type design changes by 
 means of a field approval that require ICA's must have those ICA's reviewed by the field 
 approving FSDO."
NOTE 4,"For all operations below -29°C (-20°F) ambient temperature, all JET A, JET A-1 and 
 JET B fuels used in Model 222, Model 222B and Model 222U helicopters must contain 
 Phillips PFA-55MB or MIL-L-27686 anti-icing additive in concentrations of not less 
 than 0.035% nor more than 0.15% by volume. Blending this additive into the fuel and 
 checking its concentration must be conducted in the manner prescribed by the Rotorcraft 
 Flight Manual."
NOTE 5,"Avco Lycoming engines used in the Model 222 must incorporate a shim in the fuel 
 control. Fuel Controls with the shim are identified by P/N 4-301-098-05. Engines used 
 in the production configuration (S/N 47006 to 47089) must use this shim or use 
 selectively fitted governor reset spring in accordance with Avco Lycoming Service 
 Bulletin LTS101C-73-0015."
NOTE 6,"To be considered eligible for operation in the United States, each Aircraft 
 manufactured under this Type Certificate must have a U. S. Airworthiness Certificate 
 that may be issued on the basis of the Canadian Department of Transport Certificate 
 of Airworthiness for Export signed by the Minister of Transport containing the 
 following statement 
 ""The rotorcraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to 
 comply with the type design approved under Type Certificate H9SW and to be in 
 condition for safe operation"". 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR 
 Section 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR 
 Section 21.21 exported from countries other than the country of manufacture (e.g., 
 third party country) is FAR Sections 21.183(d) or 21.185(b). 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United States of 
 both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any required 
 statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent 
 document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these 
 documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements 
 for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft."
NOTE 7,"For all operations below +5°C (23°F) ambient temperature, all JET A, JET A-1 and JET 
 B fuels used in Model 230 and 430 helicopters must contain Phillips PFA-55MB or 
 MIL-L-27686 anti-icing additive in concentration of not less than 0.035% nor more than 
 0.15% by volume. Blending this additive into the fuel and checking its concentration 
 must be conducted in the manner prescribed by the Rotorcraft Flight Manual."
NOTE 8,"The model 430 helicopter employs electronic engine controls, commonly named Full 
 Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC) and is recognized to be more susceptible to 
 Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) than rotorcraft that have only manual (non- 
 electronic) controls. (EMI may be the result of radiated or conducted interference.) For 
 this reason modifications that add or change systems that have the potential for EMI, 
 must either be qualified to an FAA acceptable standard or tested at the time of 
 installation for interference to the FADEC. This type of testing must employ the 
 particular FADEC’s diagnostic techniques and external diagnostic techniques. The test 
 procedure must be FAA approved."
NOTE 9,"Effective December 20, 2001 the name Bell Helicopter Textron, A Division of Textron 
 Canada Limited was revised to Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited. Effective 
 December 16, 2019, the name Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited was revised to 
 Bell Textron Canada Limited."
