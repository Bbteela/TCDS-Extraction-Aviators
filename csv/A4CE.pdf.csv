 Special Ferry Flight Authorization. Flight Standards District Offices are authorized to issue Special overweight 
 ferry flight authorizations. This airplane is structurally satisfactory for ferry flight if maintained within the 
 following limits: (1) Takeoff weight must not exceed 130% of the maximum weight for Normal Category, and 
 (2) The Never Exceed Airspeed (VNE) and Maximum Structural Cruising Speed (VC) must be reduced by 30%; 
 and (3) Forward and aft center of gravity limits may not be exceeded; and (4) Structural load factors of 2.5 g. to 
 -1.0 g. may not be exceeded. Requirements for any additional oil should be established in accordance with 
 Advisory Circular AC23.1011-1. Increased stall speeds and reduced climb performance should be expected for 
 the increased weights. Flight characteristics and performance at the increased weights have not been evaluated.
