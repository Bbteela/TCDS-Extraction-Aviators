Serial Nos eligible,"The United Kingdom Certificate of Airworthiness for Export endorsed as noted 
 under ""Import Requirements"" must be submitted for each individual aircraft for 
 which application of certification is made."
Transition Statement,"The United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority originally type certificated this 
 aircraft under its type certificate Number AAN10059 (HS 748 Series 2A) and 
 ANN16479 (HS 748 Series 2B) . The FAA validated this product under U.S. 
 Type Certificate Number A24EU. Effective September 28, 2003, the European 
 Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this product on behalf The 
 United Kingdom."
Import requirement,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export 
 Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the 
 United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority on behalf of the European 
 Community. The Export C of A should contain the following statement: ‘The 
 aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to 
 conform with Type Design approved under U.S. Type Certificate No. A24EU 
 and to be in a condition for safe operation.’ 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 
 FAR Section 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR 
 Sections 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for 
 aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 21.29 but exported from 
 countries other than the country of manufacture (e.g., third party country) is 
 FAR Sections 21.183(d) or 21.183(b). These sections provide that U.S. 
 airworthiness certification are issued only if the Administrator finds, “that the 
 aircraft conforms to the type design and is in a condition for safe operation.” 
 In order for the FAA to make the finding that an HS 748 aircraft is in a 
 condition for safe operation, the FAA certificating inspector or other 
 authorized person must contact the Manager, International Branch, ANM- 
 116, FAA Transport Airplane Directorate; 1601 Lind Avenue Southwest; 
 Renton, Washington 98055; telephone (425) 227-1263; fax (425) 227-1149, 
 prior to issuance of the U.S. airworthiness certificate to obtain the FAA 
 Required Modification List (RML) for the HS 748. Prior to issuance of a 
 Standard Airworthiness Certificate on any HS 748 model aircraft, all 
 modifications shown in the model HS 748 RML must be accomplished in the 
 interest of safety before the aircraft can be found to be in a condition for safe 
 operation. 
 Authority for these required modifications is given per the airworthiness 
 certification provisions of 49 U.S.C. 44704 (c), which states ""the 
 Administrator may include in an airworthiness certificate terms required in 
 the interest of safety"". “Terms required in the interest of safety” include 
 actions to correct unsafe conditions issued by the foreign authority of the state 
 of design that also meet FAA criteria for corrective action. This law also gives 
 the FAA the authority to adopt FAR § 21.183(c) and (d), which form the 
 regulatory basis for the issue of standard U.S. airworthiness certificates on 
 imported products. 14 CFR §21.183(c) and (d) provide that airworthiness 
 certificates are issued only if the Administrator finds “that the aircraft 
 conforms to the type design and is in a condition for safe operation.” The 
 modifications identified in the Model HS 748 RML are required in the interest 
 of safety and are necessary for this airplane to be in a condition for safe 
 operation. 
 A Notice of policy Statement announcing the FAA’s policy with respect to 
 foreign mandatory continued airworthiness information, when no aircraft of 
 the affected design are currently operating in the U.S. was published in the 
 Federal Register on May 1, 1998. Additional guidance is contained in the 
 FAA advisory Circular 21-23, Airworthiness Certification of Civil Aircraft, 
 Engines, Propellers, and Related Products Imported into the United States."
Service information,"Each of the documents listed below that contain a statement that it is approved 
 by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) - or for approvals made 
 before September 28, 2003 - by the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority, 
 are accepted by the FAA and are considered FAA approved. Additionally, 
 approvals issued by BAE Systems (Operations) Limited under the authority of 
 EASA approved Design Organization EASA.21J.047 - or for approvals made 
 before September 28, 2003 - under the authority of United Kingdom Civil 
 Aviation Authority or JAA Design Organization Approval No. CAA.JA.02034 
 are considered FAA approved. These approvals pertain to the type design only.

Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for 
 certification. Approved equipment is included in the Schedule of Equipment 
 Drawing No. A 3767. 
 In addition, the following items of equipment are required. 
 Control Column stick shaker 
 Safe Flight - Pt. No. C74002 
 Lift Transducer 
 Safe Flight - Pt. No. C74007 (2 required)."
NOTE 1,"(a) Current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in the 
 certificated empty weight and loading instructions when necessary, must be in each 
 aircraft at the time of original certification. 
 (b) ""Unusable Fuel and System Oil"" and all hydraulic fluid must be included with 
 certificated empty weight. 
 Unusable fuel is that quantity of fuel in the system and in the tanks which is unavailable 
 to the engine under critical flight conditions as defined in FAR 25.959. This unusable 
 fuel includes ""system fuel"" which is defined as the quantity required to fill the system 
 and tanks outlet level when the airplane is in the ground level attitude. The fuel gauges 
 are calibrated to read zero during level flight with the unusable fuel in the tanks. 
 The total amount of fuel is as follows: 
 Usable Fuel 
 Unusable Fuel 
 @ 6.75 lb./gal. 
 @ 6.75 lb./gal. 
 1680 U.S. gallons 
 3.6 U.S. gallons 
 System Oil is that amount of oil required to fill the oil system and tanks which is not 
 available for normal engine lubrication. The propeller feathering oil is not considered 
 usable oil and is included in ""System Oil"". System oil weight is 37 lb. The oil tank 
 capacity shown in this specification is the total oil for which the tanks are placarded. 
 Dipstick readings indicate the amount of oil required to fill the tank."
NOTE 2,"All placards required in the Approved Airplane Flight Manual must be installed in the 
 appropriate location."
NOTE 3,"The service life for aircraft structural parts which are fatigue critical are listed in the HS 
 748 Recommended Maintenance Schedule, pages 12 to 18 inclusive, and may not be 
 changed without FAA approval."
NOTE 4,"The approval fuel additives are listed in the CAA Approved Flight Manual Document 
 A01.10."
