NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated weight empty, and loading 
 instructions when necessary must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter 
 (except in the case of air carrier operators having an approved weight control system)."
NOTE 2,"In order to be eligible for night operations, any UC-61 Series airplane having uncertificated position lights should have 
 them replaced with approved types. If Air Force type A-9 wing-tip lights are installed, they may be used provided the 
 sand-blasted surface on the inside of the cover glass is painted black."
NOTE 3,"Prior to original certification of the UC-61K models install a single-pole, 5 ampere, toggle switch in the generator field 
 circuit. Mount this switch adjacent to the battery circuit breaker switch on the instrument panel and placard it 
 ""Generator Field Switch."" The battery circuit breaker switch and generator field switch should be ganged so either 
 simultaneous or individual action is possible. When so ganged these switches constitute a Master Switch and should 
 be so placarded."
