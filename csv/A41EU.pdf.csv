DATA PERTINENT TO ALL MODELS,
Serial Numbers Eligible,"The United Kingdom (CAA) Certificate of Airworthiness for Export, endorsed as 
 noted under ""Import Requirements"" below must be submitted for each individual 
 aircraft for which application for certification is made."
Import Requirements,"a. 
 The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on a National 
 Aviation Authority Export Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) 
 signed by a representative of the United Kingdom on behalf of the 
 European Community. The Export C of A should contain the following 
 statement: “The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, 
 tested, and found to conform with Type Design approved under U.S. 
 Type Certificated No. A41EU and be in a condition for safe operation. 
 b. 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 
 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR Sections 21.183(c) or 21.185(c)."
Transition Statement,"The United Kingdom’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) originally type certificated 
 the SD3-30, SD3-60, SD3-Sherpa, and SD3-60 Sherpa Airplanes under its type 
 certificate Number BA11. The FAA validated these products under U.S. Type 
 Certificate Number A41EU. Effective September 28, 2003, the European Aviation 
 Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this product on behalf of the United 
 Kingdom."
Certification Basis,"SD3-30 Airplanes:
