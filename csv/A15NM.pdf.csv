NOTE 2,"A. 
 Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated weight empty, 
 and loading instructions when necessary must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification 
 and at all times thereafter. 
 B. 
 The location of the center of gravity for any gross weight configuration, determined from T.O. 1-1B- 
 40, Handbook of Weight and Balance Data, must fall within the percent of the mean aerodynamic 
 chord (MAC) shown on the Center of Gravity Limitations Chart (figure 5-6). For information and 
 method of calculating the airplane center of gravity, refer to T.O. 1C-130A-9, Cargo Loading 
 Handbook and T.O. 1-1B-40, Handbook of Weight and Balance Data.
