Equipment,"A Plus (+) or minus (-) sign preceding the weight of an item indicates net weight change when that item is 
 installed. 
 Approval for the installation of all items of equipment listed herein has been obtained by the aircraft manufacturer 
 except those items preceded by an asterisk (*). The asterisk denotes that approval has been obtained by someone 
 other than the aircraft manufacturer. An item marked with an asterisk may not have been manufactured under a 
 FAA monitored or approved quality control system, and therefore conformity must be determined if the item is

NOTE A,"Contact the Howard Aircraft Foundation for information on eligible manufacturer’s serial numbers and 
 corresponding civilian model. The HAF maintains a list of all model DGA-15 aircraft manufactured from 1939 to 
 1944, including all military versions either impressed into Army service or produced under contract for the Navy."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and loading 
 instructions when necessary, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification."
NOTE 2,"(a) Navy Models GH-1, GH-2, GH-3 and NH-1 are eligible for certification as Model DGA-15P when finger 
 strainers having not more than 10 meshes per inch are installed in outlets of all fuel tanks and selector valves 
 are placarded as required by pertinent weight and balance report. 
 Each airplane must be weighed to determine its weight and balance and loading instructions provided, if 
 necessary. 
 To achieve proper weight and balance, with changes in equipment, either the method described under (1) or under 
 (2) may be used. 
 (1) It is permissible to remove the following airplane placards: 
 At filler caps - 
 ""Fill front tank first, main tank second, rear tank last"". 
 At the fuel selector valve. 
 ""Use rear tank first, main tank second, front tank last"". 
 Placards governing the sequence of fuel tank filling and use and loading schedules will be determined by the 
 individual airplane weight and balance report. 
 (2) Lead ballast (not to exceed 33 lbs.) may be installed at the tail post to conform with the specified C.G. range, 
 provided a placard is installed in full view of the pilot, reading ""Intentional spins prohibited"". 
 Upon completion of the conversion to certificated status, the manufacturer's nameplate on the aircraft should be altered to"
include the new commercial model designation. In case the original nameplate is not sufficiently large to include this,
