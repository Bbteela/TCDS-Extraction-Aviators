 Previous to this date: 
 The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export Certificate 
 of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the Luftfahrt Bundesamt 
 on behalf of the European Community. The Export C of A should contain the following 
 statement: ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found 
 to comply with U.S. airworthiness regulations 14 CFR Part 23 approved under U.S. 
 Type Certificate No. A58EU and to be in a condition for safe operation.’"
Certification Basis,"1) 14 CFR Sections 21.29, 21.183(c), and 14 CFR 23, effective January 9, 
 1965, including Amendments 23-1 through 23.28, and 
 2) 14 CFR Part 36, effective December 1, 1969, including 36-1 through 
 amendment 36-17, and 
 3) Special Conditions; Gyroflug Speed Canard published in Federal Register

 4) Section 611(b) of the FAA Act of 1958 
 Application for Type Certificate dated February 2, 1987. 
 The Luftfahrt Bundesamt originally type certificated this aircraft under its type certificate 
 Number 1066. The FAA validated this product under U.S. Type Certificate Number 
 A58EU. Effective September 28, 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) 
 began oversight of this product on behalf of Germany."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulation (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft. 
 This equipment must include a current Pilot's Operating Manual."
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the European 
 Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before September 28, 2003 – 
 by the Luftfahrt Bundesamt. 
 • Service bulletins, 
 • Structural repair manuals, 
 • Vendor manuals, 
 • Aircraft flight manuals, and 
 • Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved unless one of the 
 following conditions exists: 
 • The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures of the FAA 
 approved manuals; or 
 •The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this product’s U.S. type 
 certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. The 
 FAA may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to approve on behalf of the FAA for the 
 U.S. type certificate. If this is the case it will be noted on the document."
NOTE 1,"A current weight and balance report together with a list of included equipment must be provided for each 
 aircraft at the time of original certification. The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of 
 gravity locations must include the following: 
 a) 
 Unusable fuel of 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) 122.8 in (312 cm) aft of datum 
 b) 
 engine oil of 8 quarts"
NOTE 2,The placards listed in Section 2 of the LBA-approved Airplane Flight Manual must be displayed.
NOTE 3,"Every 3,000 flight hours the ""Significant Structural Items Inspection"" and prior to 12,000 flight hours 
 the ""Airframe Major Inspection"" contained in the FAA approved airworthiness limitation section of the 
 Gyroflug-FFT maintenance manual must be performed."
NOTE 4,"Structural composite components exposed directly to sunlight must have a white surface (except 
 for registration markings). Changing the color and the thickness of the coat is only permissible 
 after prior approval by the manufacturer."
NOTE 5,"Major structural repairs must be accomplished at FAA certified repair stations rated for composite 
 aircraft structure work, in accordance with Gyroflug repair methods approved by FAA."
NOTE 6,The airplane is approved for IFR day/night flights.
NOTE 7,"Acrobatic maneuvers, including spins, are not approved."

NOTE 9,"For issuance of an airworthiness certificate in accordance with 14 CFR Part 21.182(c), the Luftfahrt Bundesamt of 
 Germany must certify that the airplane conforms to the type design and is in a condition for safe operation. In that 
 regard, the Luftfahrt Bundesamt of Germany will certify that the airplane complies with all applicable mandatory 
 continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) it has issued. For issuance of an airworthiness certificate in 
 accordance with 14 CFR Part 21.182(d) the certificating inspector, or other authorized person, must find, among 
 other things, that the product is in a condition for safe operation. In order to make that finding, the certificating 
 inspector or other authorized person should contact ACE-112, Federal Aviation Administration, Small Airplane 
 Directorate, prior to issuance to determine whether showing airplane compliance with certain MCAI is necessary 
 to support a finding that the airplane is in a condition for safe operation."
