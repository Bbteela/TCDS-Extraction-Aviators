"I - Model 767-200 (Approved July 30, 1982)",
Engines,"2 Pratt and Whitney JT9D-7R4D, JT9D-7R4E, JT9D-7R4E4, PW4052, PW4056, PW4060A, or 2 General Electric 
 CF6-80A, CF6-80A2, CF6-80C2-B2, -B4, -B6 or CF6-80C2B4F, -B6F, -B7F. 
 WARNING: To prevent unsafe airplane handling characteristics, PW4000 series engines with electronic engine 
 control (EEC) part number 791100-14-102 (Pratt & Whitney part number 54D043) must not be installed on the 
 same airplane as PW4000 series engines that have the ring case compressor configuration. This combination of 
 engine configurations is not approved because of a significant difference in engine acceleration rates and the effect 
 of that difference on airplane handling characteristics. Ring case compressor equipped engines were approved with 
 the same engine model number as previously approved PW4000 configurations, and must be identified by the 
 presence of a “/A5” marked at the end of the “INSTL ARR” block on the engine data plate. 
 The General Electric CF6-80A engines may be intermixed with CF6-8 0A2 engines with appropriate limitations as 
 noted in the FAA-Approved Airplane Flight Manual."

 II - 767-200SF Major Design Change 
 A 767-200SF (Special Freighter) is a 767-200 series passenger airplane that has been modified in accordance with FAA-approved 
 Boeing Service Bulletin(s) 767-00-0038 to operate in a freighter configuration. These aircraft remain 767-200 series aircraft for 
 documentation purposes on this TCDS and with regard to the applicability of airworthiness directives. Because of the magnitude 
 of thisdesign change, the certification basis for the changed aspects was required to be established and documented in accordance 
 with section 21.101 (Changed Product Rule) 
 All general information in TCDS A1NM for the 767-200 Series remains applicable to an airplane operating in the 767-"
200SFconfiguration with the following exceptions,"Maximum Passengers: There are no provisions for the carriage of passengers. A maximum of four supernumeraries canoccupy 
 the flight deck as given in Exemption 9749A. 
 The 767-200SF certification basis was established according to the requirements given in § 21.101 and AC 21.101-1, and was 
 determined in accordance with FAA Order 8110.48. The 767-200SF consists of the following product level change which is"
considered significant per AC 211011,"Significant Product Level Change: Passenger to Freighter Conversion

 WARNING: To prevent unsafe airplane handling characteristics, PW4000 series engines with electronic engine 
 control (EEC) part number 791100-14-102 (Pratt & Whitney part number 54D043) must not be installed on the same 
 airplane as PW4000 series engines that have the ring case compressor configuration. This combination of engine 
 configurations is not approved because of a significant difference in engine acceleration rates and the effect of that 
 difference on airplane handling characteristics. Ring case compressor equipped engines were approved with the 
 same engine model number as previously approved PW4000 configurations, and must be identified by the presence 
 of a “/A5 marked at the end of the “INSTL ARR” block on the engine data plate."
