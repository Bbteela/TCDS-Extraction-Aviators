NOTE 2,"A. 
 Current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in 
 certificated weight empty, and loading instructions when necessary must be 
 in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter. 
 B. 
 The location of the center of gravity for any gross weight configuration, determined 
 from T.O. 1-1B-40, Handbook of Weight and Balance Data, must fall within the 
 percent of the mean aerodynamic chord (MAC) shown on the Center of Gravity 
 limitations Chart (figure 5-6). For information and method of calculating the 
 airplane center of gravity, refer to T.O. 1C-130B-9, Cargo Loading Handbook and 
 T.O. 1-1B-40, Handbook of Weight and Balance Data. 
 C. 
 The weight of the system fuel and oil, as defined below, and hydraulic fluid must be
