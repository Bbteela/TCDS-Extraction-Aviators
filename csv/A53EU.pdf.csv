 NOTES 
 NOTE 1 - Weight and Balance 
 a 
 Current weight and balance report including list of equipment, entitled ""Aircraft Inspection 
 Report"", included in certificated empty weight, and loading instructions, must be in each aircraft 
 at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter except in the case of operators 
 having an approved weight control systems. ATR Report, ""Weight and Balance Manual"", contains 
 loading information for each airplane and interior arrangement configuration as delivered. This 
 report contains, or refers to, information relative to location and capacity of all cargo and 
 baggage compartments, buffets, storage spaces and coat rooms, location and capacity of lounges, 
 lavatories, and the required placards in the passenger compartment. 
 b 
 The airplane must be loaded so that the C.G. is within specified limits at all times, considering 
 fuel loading and usage, gear retraction and movement of crew and passengers from their assigned 
 positions. 
 c 
 The weights of system fuel and oil, as defined below, and hydraulic fluid, all of which must be 
 included in the airplane empty weight, are listed for each airplane in the Weight and Balance Manual 
 specified in paragraph (a) above. 
 d 
 System fuel is the weight of all fuel required to fill all lines and tanks up to zero-fuel point on the fuel gages in the 
 most critical flight attitude, including the unusable tank fuel as defined by FAR Part 25.959. (The usable fuel in the 
 crossfeed manifold lines, manifolds, and engine that is not part of the system, fuel must be included in the total usable 
 fuel to obtain correct weight and C.G. for take off). 
 e 
 The unusable fuel is that amount of fuel in the tanks which is unavailable to the engines under critical flight conditions 
 as defined in FAR Part 25.959. This ""unusable"" fuel is included in System Fuel as indicated in (d) above and need not 
 be accounted for separately. 
 f 
 System oil is the weight of oil remaining in the engine, lines and tanks after subtracting the oil in the tanks which is 
 above the standpipe (zero gauge) levels. The engine oil capacities shown elsewhere in this data sheet include only the 
 useable oil for which the tanks must be placarded. 
 NOTE 2 
 The aircraft must be operated in accordance with the DGAC-Approved FAA Airplane Flight Manual. 
 (""DGAC approved"" is considered equivalent to ""FAA Approved""). 
 NOTE 3 
 The required Airworthiness limitations including structural inspections and retirements times for safe life

 NOTE 1 - Weight and Balance 
 a 
 Current weight and balance report including list of equipment, entitled ""Aircraft Inspection ""Report"", included in 
 certificated empty weight, and loading instructions, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at 
 all times thereafter except in the case of operators having an approved weight control system. ATR Report, ""Weight 
 and Balance Manual"", contains loading information for each airplane and interior arrangement configuration as 
 delivered. This report contains, or refers to, information relative to location and capacity of all cargo and 
 baggage compartments, buffets, storage spaces and coat rooms, location and capacity of lounges, lavatories, and the 
 required placards in the passenger compartment. 
 b 
 The airplane must be loaded so that the C.G. is within specified limits at all times, considering fuel loading and usage, 
 gear retraction and movement of crew and passengers from their assigned positions. 
 c 
 The weights of system fuel and oil, as defined below, and hydraulic fluid, all of which must be included in the airplane 
 empty weight, are listed for each airplane in the Weight and Balance Manual specified in paragraph (a) above. 
 d 
 System fuel is the weight of all fuel required to fill all lines and tanks up to zero-fuel point on the fuel pages in the 
 most critical flight attitude, including the unusable tank fuel as defined by FAR Part 25.959. (The usable fuel in the 
 crossfeed manifold lines, manifolds, and engine that is not part of the system, fuel must be included in total usable fuel 
 to obtain correct weight and C.G. for take off). 
 e 
 The unusable fuel is that amount of fuel in the tanks which is unavailable to the engines under critical flight conditions 
 as defined in FAR Part 25.959. This ""unusable"" fuel is included in System Fuel as indicated in (d) above and need not 
 be accounted for separately. 
 f 
 System oil is the weight of oil remaining in the engine, lines and tanks after subtracting the oil in the tanks which is 
 above the standpipe (zero gauge) levels. The engine oil capacities shown elsewhere in this data sheet include only the 
 useable oil for which the tanks must be placarded. 
 NOTE 2 
 The aircraft must be operated in accordance with the DGAC/EASA-Approved FAA Airplane Flight Manual. 
 (""DGAC/EASA approved"" is considered equivalent to ""FAA Approved""). 
 NOTE 3 
 The required Airworthiness limitations including structural inspections and retirements times for safe life parts are 
 covered by the ""Time Limits"" document, Revision 18, dated October 09, 2020, for ATR 72, approved by EASA.
