 and 
 Required 
 Maintenance/Inspections/Reporting: 
 Chapter 5-10-10 of the Gulfstream G280 Maintenance Manual, part number G280-1001-3, basic 
 issue, dated August 24, 2012 contains the Airworthiness Limitations Section required by 14 CFR part 
 25 appendix H25.4. Later revisions to the Chapter 5-10-10 must be approved prior to incorporation 
 into the maintenance program of airplanes operated under the type certificate. The Chapter 5-10-10 
 includes the following components: 
 • 
 Life limited components are listed in the Tables 4 and 5. 
 • 
 The mandatory systems certification maintenance requirements, raised from the safety analysis, 
 are listed in the Table 6. 
 • 
 The fuel tank system airworthiness limitations are listed in the Table 6. 
 • 
 The fuel tank system critical design configuration control limitations (CDCCLs) are listed in 
 the Table 7. 
 Additionally, the FAA has concluded that the occurrence of any uncontrollable high-thrust failure 
 condition, or any of the associated causal failures listed in Chapter 05-10-10 of the G280 Maintenance 
 Manual, may endanger the safe operation of an airplane, and hence are reportable under Title 14, 
 Code of Federal Regulations 121.703(c), 125.409(c), and 135.415(c)."
NOTE 4,"The type design defined by GALP drawings 30P000999900-501 Revision A and report 
 30P000/120060 Revision New includes approved seating for pilot and copilot only, and has peculiar 
 provisions and limitations linked to this limited occupancy. A forward observer seat is not included 
 in the approved type design. 
 Modifications intended to expand occupancy provisions to other than pilot and copilot seating 
 approved under the TC must be approved. Certification guidance for interior installations is provided 
 in GALP report 30P090/060643 Rev. A or higher “G280 Certification Specification for the Green 
 Aircraft Completion Center Interface.” 
 In addition to occupancy considerations noted above, compliance to 14 CFR 25.809(a) was found: 
 (a) 
 for the over wing exit by using both the window in the exit and the window immediately forward 
 of the exit. It isn’t possible to view the likely area of evacuee ground contact from the over wing 
 exit window therefore the window immediately forward of the exit was used for this purpose. 
 No items may be installed between the over wing exit and the window immediately forward of 
 the over wing exit that could cause an obstruction. Questions regarding a proposed installation 
 in this area must be coordinated with the TC issuing office. 
 (b) 
 for the Main Entry Door (MED) exit by using the left hand (LH) forward-most cabin window 
 which is immediately aft of and adjacent to the MED. No items may be installed that could cause 
 an obstruction of this window, unless alternative viewing means are approved. Questions 
 regarding a proposed installation in this area must be coordinated with the TC issuing office."
NOTE 5,"The G280 model incorporates integrated avionics systems using software-based line replaceable units 
 (LRUs) which share a digital transmission bus. Modification to the LRU software or alteration of the 
 LRU interface could adversely affect the airworthiness of the certified product. LRU software 
 configurations approved under the TC are defined in GALP Document 30P8000005 Rev.W, “TOP 
 ELECT.& AVIONIC PART LIST BASIC FINAL ASSY.” Changes to the integrated avionics system 
 must be approved."
NOTE 6,"G280 airplane serial numbers 2003 through 2009 were imported into the U.S. under the provisional 
 TC issued March 1, 2012. These serial number airplanes did not conform to the FAA-approved type 
 design definition at the time of import. Eligibility for a standard certificate of airworthiness on these 
 airplanes requires a determination of conformity to the type design definition approved under the 
 FAA TC. The modifications necessary to bring these airplanes from the exported configuration to the 
 FAA TC type design configuration are described in a Task Transfer Reports (TTR) prepared for each 
 serial number airplane, according to the G280 GALP PTC to TC Configuration Management Plan, 
 IAI Document Number 30P002/120376, Revision A, dated July 26, 2012."
