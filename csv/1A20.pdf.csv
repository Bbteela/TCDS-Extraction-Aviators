 all times thereafter except in the case of operators having an approved weight control system. 
 (b) 
 The airplane must be loaded so that the C.G. is within the specified limits at all times with the effects of 
 fuel use taken into account. The fuel loading and consumption must be in accordance with schedule 
 given in Tables 1 through 4 of Section 2 of the DOT approved Flight Manual. 
 (c) 
 Systems fuel, which must be included in the empty weight, is the amount of fuel required to fill the

 The total weight of cargo and passenger service facilities (i.e., galleys, toilets, partitions, etc.) in 
 Compartment N must not exceed 4,200 lb. 
 (2) 
 Cargo in Compartment N loaded forward of Station 1303 must not exceed 3,200 lb. 
 (3) 
 The total longitudinal moment of cargo and of passenger service facilities in Compartment N, 
 measured with respect to Station 1228.5, must not exceed 258,000 inch pounds. 
 (4) 
 The total lateral moment of cargo and of passenger service facilities in Compartment N, measured 
 with respect to the hinge line BL 68 RH, must not exceed 201,500 inch pounds. 
 (5) 
 The seat rails in Compartment N must not be used for crash restraint of cargo in excess of 1,400 lb. 
 (6) 
 The forward center-of-gravity limits of Page 5, Item (b), apply. 
 In Placard Nos. 1 through 4, the maximum allowable floor loadings shown for all compartments except F and 
 G are limited by floor panel strength. The floor supporting structure for all compartments is approved for a 
 maximum allowable loading equivalent to 300 lb./sq. feet.

 Compartment ""A"" is located in the lower hold and is restricted to a floor load of 150 lb./ft. run with 
 a maximum of 800 lb. 
 (2) 
 The maximum allowable floor loadings shown for all compartments are limited by floor panel 
 strength. With the exception of Compartments ""A"" and ""P"", the floor supporting structure for all 
 compartments is approved for a maximum allowable loading equivalent to 300 p.s.f."
NOTE 3,"Special Fatigue or Retirement Considerations Applicable 
 (a) 
 The basic airframe is life limited to 40,000 hours, or 13,500 landings, whichever occurs first, subject to 
 the special inspections of Canadair Service Information Circulars Nos. 176-CL-44D4 and 268-CL-44D4. 
 (b) 
 When an airplane Model CL-44D4 is converted to a Model CL-44J, the life limit of the Model J must be 
 reduced by the service hours and landings accumulated on the model D4 at the time of conversion. 
 (c) 
 Control rod end fittings, P/N 28-90031, of the elevator control system must be replaced at intervals of 
 10,000 hours in accordance with Service Bulletin No. CL-44D4-201. 
 (d) 
 Airplane Models CL-44D4 and CL-44J whose serial numbers are listed in Canadair Service Information 
 Circular No. 380-CL44, are eligible for removal of the basic airframe life limitation, reference items (a) 
 and (b). Eligibility is contingent upon compliance with the requirements of Canadair S.I.C. No. 380- 
 CL44, at or before the basic airframe life limitation of paragraph (a) is reached."
