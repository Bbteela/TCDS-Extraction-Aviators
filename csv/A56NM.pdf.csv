 Deflections are in the planes normal to the hinge lines, except for the flaps, which are in 
 streamwise planes normal to the wing reference plane. Deflections of a surface supported 
 by another moveable surface are relative to the parent surface. Stabilizer deflections are 
 relative to the airplane horizontal reference. Elevator and rudder maximum deflections 
 are scheduled by the flight control system as a function of airspeed; the data presented 
 herein correspond to zero airspeed. Control surface deflection tolerances are given in the

 DATA PERTINENT TO ALL MODELS EXCEPT AS INDICATED",
Import Requirements,"Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness 
 (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification 
 of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported 
 aircraft.” 
 NOTE: In order for the FAA to determine that a Model ERJ 170-200 LL aircraft is in a 
 condition for safe operation under the provisions of 14 CFR 21.183, prior to issuance of 
 the U.S. airworthiness certificate the FAA certificating inspector or other authorized 
 person must ensure the aircraft complies with the FAA Required Airworthiness Action 
 List (RAAL) for the ERJ 170-200 LL. 
 The RAAL contains a list of type design modifications and inspections that have been 
 determined by the Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil (ANAC), which is the state of 
 design authority for the Embraer ERJ 170, to be required to correct unsafe conditions 
 discovered on the original type design of the ERJ 170. ANAC has issued Airworthiness 
 Directives – MCAI - that require the accomplishment of these modifications and 
 inspections to correct the identified unsafe conditions, and has advised the FAA of this 
 MCAI. Based on these MCAI the FAA has determined that certain FAA ADs applicable 
 to the Model ERJ 170-200 LR are also applicable to the Model ERJ 170-200 LL and have 
 been added to the RAAL. The FAA has determined that the airworthiness actions 
 identified in the FAA ADs listed in ERJ 170-200 LL RAAL are required in the interest of 
 safety and are necessary for this airplane to be in a condition for safe operation. 
 Prior to issuance of a Standard Airworthiness Certificate on a Model ERJ 170-200 LL 
 aircraft, all airworthiness actions applicable to the Model 170-200 LR in the ADs listed in 
 the ERJ 170-200 LL RAAL must be accomplished in accordance with the compliance 
 times listed in each AD. The ADs listed in the RAAL are airworthiness limitations in 
 addition to those listed in note 3 of this TCDS, and must be included in the operator’s 
 airplane maintenance or inspection program. All inspections or modifications, required 
 by the ADs listed in the RAAL, which have surpassed the initial compliance time, must 
 be accomplished prior to issuance of the Standard Airworthiness Certificate. 
 ERJ 170-200 LL RAAL: 
 - FAA AD 2013-11-17 (Actions applicable to Model 170-200 LR) 
 - FAA AD 2013-25-04 (Actions applicable to Model 170-200 LR) 
 - FAA AD 2016-12-14 (Actions applicable to Model 170-200 LR) 
 Any deviation from the requirements of the ADs listed in the RAAL must be approved by 
 the Manager, International Section, AIR-676, FAA Transport Standards Staff; 2200 
 South 216th Street, Des Moines, WA 98198; telephone (206) 231-3154.
