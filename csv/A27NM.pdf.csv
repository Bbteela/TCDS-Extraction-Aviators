 NOTE: 
 MAXIMUM TAKEOFF rating is the maximum certified for takeoff operation. This rating is 
 referred to as Max Contingency in airplane markings and the Airplane Flight Manual. When the TAKEOFF 
 mode is selected the MAXIMUM TAKEOFF rating is available through actuation of the fuel control 
 Automatic Takeoff Power Control System (ATCPS) when engine is operating at the NORMAL TAKEOFF 
 rating or manually by throttle movement. 
 NORMAL TAKEOFF rating is the maximum thrust to be set for takeoff operation with the aircraft 
 Automatic Takeoff Power Control System (ATPCS) operative. This rating is referred to asTakeoff in 
 airplane markings and the Airplane Flight Manual. When set, this rating ensures that the MAXIMUM 
 TAKEOFF rating will be achieved upon actuation of ATPCS. 
 (a) Overspeed due to propeller system malfunction permissible up to 115% for Max 15 minutes subject to 
 maintenance action. 
 (b) Oil temperature must be maintained above 45C to ensure protection against intake icing. 
 (c) Below 56 psi reduce power (NH less than 75%), below 41 psi shutdown. 
 (d) Below flight idle. 
 (e) 5 seconds 
 (f) Power above flight idle not allowed for oil temperature below 0C. 
 (g) Never exceed torque limit (excluding transients) - 103.9% at a maximum NP of 85%. 
 (h) The above limitations are defined by the torque capacity of the engine/gearbox combination. The 
 torque settings for normal operation are given in the airplane flight manual."

Serial Nos Eligible,"A United Kingdom Certificate of Airworthiness for Export endorsed as noted under 
 “Import Requirements” below must be submitted for each individual airplane for which 
 application for United States certification is made."
Transition Statement,"The United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority originally type certificated this 
 aircraft under its type certificate Number BA23. The FAA validated this 
 product under U.S. Type Certificate Number A24EU. Effective September 28, 
 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this 
 product on behalf The United Kingdom."
Import requirement,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export 
 Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the 
 United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority on behalf of the European 
 Community. The Export C of A should contain the following statement: ‘The 
 aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to 
 conform with Type Design approved under U.S. Type Certificate No. A27NM 
 and to be in a condition for safe operation.’ 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 
 FAR Section 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR 
 Sections 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for 
 aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 21.29 but exported from 
 countries other than the country of manufacture (e.g., third party country) is 
 FAR Sections 21.183(d) or 21.183(b). These sections provide that U.S. 
 airworthiness certification are issued only if the Administrator finds, “that the 
 aircraft conforms to the type design and is in a condition for safe operation.” 
 In order for the FAA to make the finding that an ATP aircraft is in a 
 condition for safe operation, the FAA certificating inspector or other 
 authorized person must contact the Manager, International Branch, ANM- 
 116, FAA Transport Airplane Directorate; 1601 Lind Avenue Southwest; 
 Renton, Washington 98055; telephone (425) 227-1263; fax (425) 227-1149, 
 prior to issuance of the U.S. airworthiness certificate to obtain the FAA 
 Required Modification List (RML) for the ATP. Prior to issuance of a 
 Standard Airworthiness Certificate on any ATP model aircraft, all 
 modifications shown in the model ATP RML must be accomplished in the 
 interest of safety before the aircraft can be found to be in a condition for safe 
 operation. 
 Authority for these required modifications is given per the airworthiness 
 certification provisions of 49 U.S.C. 44704 (c), which states ""the 
 Administrator may include in an airworthiness certificate terms required in 
 the interest of safety"". “Terms required in the interest of safety” include 
 actions to correct unsafe conditions issued by the foreign authority of the state 
 of design that also meet FAA criteria for corrective action. This law also gives 
 the FAA the authority to adopt FAR § 21.183(c) and (d), which form the 
 regulatory basis for the issue of standard U.S. airworthiness certificates on 
 imported products. 14 CFR §21.183(c) and (d) provide that airworthiness 
 certificates are issued only if the Administrator finds “that the aircraft 
 conforms to the type design and is in a condition for safe operation.” The 
 modifications identified in the Model ATP RML are required in the interest of 
 safety and are necessary for this airplane to be in a condition for safe 
 operation. 
 A Notice of policy Statement announcing the FAA’s policy with respect to 
 foreign mandatory continued airworthiness information, when no aircraft of 
 the affected design are currently operating in the U.S. was published in the 
 Federal Register on May 1, 1998. Additional guidance is contained in the 
 FAA advisory Circular 21-23, Airworthiness Certification of Civil Aircraft, 
 Engines, Propellers, and Related Products Imported into the United States."
