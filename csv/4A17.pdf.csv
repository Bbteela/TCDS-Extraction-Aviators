 instructions, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter (except in 
 the case of air carrier operators having an approved weight control system). See approved Master Equipment 
 List (LAC Report 11866) for list of approved items of equipment in addition to those items listed in this 
 specification. 
 (b) The airplane must be loaded so that the C.G. is within the specified limits at all times, with the effects of fuel 
 use, gear retraction, and movement of crew and passengers from their assigned positions being considered 
 (retraction of the main and nose gears causes the C.G. to move forward; a value of 208,000 in. lbs. is a 
 satisfactory approximation of the change in moment for all approved wheel items). At takeoff, the airplane 
 shall be loaded so that, due to fuel use, the C.G. cannot move forward of 15% MAC. A 34% aft C.G. limit 
 (gear retracted) for cruising flight may be used when the effect of passenger and crew movements from their 
 assigned positions has been taken into account. 
 Unusable fuel is that quantity of fuel in the system and in the tanks which is unavailable to the engines under 
 critical flight conditions as defined in CAR 4b.416. This unusable fuel, includes ""system fuel"" which is 
 defined as the quantity required to fill the system and tanks to the tank outlet level when the airplane is in the 
 ground level attitude. The fuel gages are calibrated with the unusable fuel level as the zero datum. The total 
 amount of fuel (Unusable included in Item 101) is as follows:

 System oil is that amount of oil required to fill the oil systems and tanks to the tank outlets to the engines. The 
 propeller feathering oil is not considered usable oil, and, when applicable, is included in ""System Oil."" The oil 
 tank capacities shown in this specification include only the usable oil for which the tanks are placarded. Dipstick 
 readings indicate the amount of usable oil.

 Operating Manual. 
 (3) Fuel in Tank No. 7 will reduce the operational zero fuel weight by the amount of fuel therein at takeoff.
