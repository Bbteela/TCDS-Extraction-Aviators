 Revised October 3, 1980. 
 There may be approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) amendments or supplements 
 issued after the original type certificate, that are required to operate the helicopter when 
 additional equipment is installed and/or when certain modifications are embodied. 
 The helicopter owner/operator should ensure that the correct approved RFM amendments 
 or supplements are incorporated in the approved RFM, for the approved model."
Service Information,"Service bulletins, structural repair manuals, aircraft flight manuals, and overhaul and 
 maintenance manuals, which contain a statement that the document is Registro 
 Aeronautico Italiano (RAI) approved, are accepted by the FAA and are considered FAA

 under this type certificate must be accompanied by a certificate of airworthiness for 
 export or certifying statement endorsed by the exporting foreign civil airworthiness 
 authority which states (in the English language): This aircraft conforms to its U.S. type 
 design (type certificate number H14EU) and is in a condition for .safe operation. 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 
 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR Sections 21.183(c) or 
 21.185(c). 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 
 21.29 exported from countries other than the country of manufacture (e.g., third party 
 country) is FAR Sections 21.183(d) or 21.183(b)."

 ""THIS HELICOPTER MUST BE OPERATED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE OPERATING 
 LIMITATIONS SPECIFIED IN THE FAA APPROVED HELICOPTER FLIGHT MANUAL."""
NOTE 3,"Information essential to the proper maintenance of the helicopter is contained in the manufacturer's 
 maintenance manual provided with each helicopter, which specifies that service life limited parts be retired 
 in accordance with the following: 
 Model AS-61N 
 Section 2C. ""List of retireable parts and time limits,"" of Sikorsky Service Bulletin No. 61B General-1L, 
 dated December 16, 1981."
NOTE 4,"A modification of the Model AS-61N, replacing the amphibious landing gear with a Sikorsky Model S-61L 
 fixed 1and type gear in accordance with Sikorsky Aircraft Drawing S6107-25112, ""Modification Kit, 
 Sponson to Fixed Landing Gear,"" has been approved for operations at 20,500 lbs. gross weight. With this 
 modification, the Model S-61N is converted to a Transport Helicopter (Categories A and B)."
NOTE 5,"Engine controls must be set to this rating for Category A vertical operation (Ground-level and Elevated 
 Heliports) and Category A Elevated Heliport Edge Procedures."
NOTE 6,"If take-off power is used in cumulative excess of 5 minutes during any one emergency, the engine must be 
 inspected in accordance with G.E. Commercial Engine Service Memorandum CT58-110-1, Maintenance No.
