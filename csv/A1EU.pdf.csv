 Date of Application for Type Certificate November 2, 1962 
 U.S. Civil Air Regulation Part 3, dated May 15, 1958, including amendments 3-1 through 
 3-7. 
 The Luftfahrt Bundesamt originally type certificated this aircraft under its type certificate 
 Number 644. The FAA validated this product under U.S. Type Certificate Number 
 A1EU. Effective September 28, 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) 
 began oversight of this product on behalf of Germany. 
 The EASA type certificate for the Bölkow Junior model is EASA.A.358."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft 
 for certification. In addition, the following items of equipment are required: 
 (a) Pre-stall warning indicator, Safe Flight Instrument Corp. 
 Part No. C-75201 and 1-02-019. 
 (b) Shoulder harness 
 (c) Approved flight manual dated August, 1963."
Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export Certificate 
 of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the Luftfahrt Bundesamt 
 on behalf of the European Community. The Export C of A should contain the following 
 statement: ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found 
 to comply with U.S. Civil Air Regulation Part 3 approved under U.S. Type Certificate 
 No. A1EU and to be in a condition for safe operation.’"
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the European 
 Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before September 28, 2003 – 
 by the Luftfahrt Bundesamt. 
 • Service bulletins, 
 • Structural repair manuals, 
 • Vendor manuals, 
 • Aircraft flight manuals, and 
 • Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved unless one of the 
 following conditions exists: 
 • The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures of the FAA 
 approved manuals; or 
 •The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this product’s U.S. type 
 certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. The 
 FAA may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to approve on behalf of the FAA for the 
 U.S. type certificate. If this is the case it will be noted on the document."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty 
 weight, and loading instructions when necessary, must be in each aircraft at the time of 
 original certification."
NOTE 2,"The following placard must be displayed on the instrument panel in full view of the pilot: 
 ""This airplane must be operated as a normal or utility category airplane in compliance with the 
 operating limitations stated in the approved Airplane Flight Manual."""
NOTE 3,"Aircraft must be assembled and inspected in accordance with Luftfahrt Bundesamt approved 
 Bolkow ""Assembly Instructions dated August 1693, Reassembly Inspection Report dated 
 September 1963, and Production Flight Test Report dated August 1963""."
NOTE 4,"For issuance of an airworthiness certificate in accordance with 14 CFR Part 21.182(c), the Luftfahrt 
 Bundesamt of Germany must certify that the airplane conforms to the type design and is in a condition for 
 safe operation. In that regard, the Luftfahrt Bundesamt of Germany will certify that the airplane complies 
 with all applicable mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) it has issued. For issuance of 
 an airworthiness certificate in accordance with 14 CFR Part 21.182(d) the certificating inspector, or other 
 authorized person, must find, among other things, that the product is in a condition for safe operation. In 
 order to make that finding, the certificating inspector or other authorized person should contact ACE-112, 
 Federal Aviation Administration, Small Airplane Directorate, prior to issuance to determine whether 
 showing airplane compliance with certain MCAI is necessary to support a finding that the airplane is in a 
 condition for safe operation."
NOTE 7,"Some of these transfers were not notified to the FAA and so in some instances the actual type certificates 
 were not reissued."
