Import requirements,"To be considered eligible for operation in the United States, each aircraft 
 manufactured under this type certification must be accompanied by a certificate of 
 airworthiness for export or certifying statement endorsed by the exporting foreign 
 civil airworthiness authority which states (in the English language): This aircraft 
 conforms to its U.S. type design (type certification number A7PC) and is in a 
 condition for safe operation. 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 
 FAR Section 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR Sections 
 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 
 FAR Section 21.29 exported from countries other than the country of manufacture 
 (e.g., third party country) is FAR Sections 21.183(d) or 21.183(b). 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness 
 (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification 
 of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported
