PRODUCTION BASIS,"Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation 
 Production Certificate Number 105 
 Keystone Helicopter Corporation, Production Certificate Number 121 NE, 
 under licensing agreement with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation. 
 In the event of an application for a standard airworthiness certificate or, if 
 an applicant intends to produce a new aircraft under 14 CFR § 
 21.183(d), and the applicant is manufacturing, building, or assembling to 
 another person’s type certificate, the applicant must provide written 
 evidence of permission from the type certificate holder. Conduct of such 
 activity without written evidence of permission may be a violation of 49 
 U.S.C. § 44704(a)(3)."
EQUIPMENT,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable 
 Airworthiness regulations (see Certification Basis) must be installed in 
 the aircraft for certification. 
 In addition, the following item(s) of equipment is (are) required: 
 Rotorcraft Flight Manual as shown in FAA Approved Sikorsky document 
 SA S92A-FMCD-000. This document specifies the applicable flight 
 manual number for each aircraft. The applicable flight manual number is 
 determined by the aircraft configuration. SA S92A-FMCD-000 will be 
 revised as required to add additional rotorcraft flight manual numbers, 
 new revisions, and new aircraft as appropriate. 
 - NOTES -"
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in certified empty 
 weight, and loading instructions, when necessary, must be provided for each rotorcraft at 
 the time of original certification. The certificated empty weight and corresponding C.G. 
 locations must include un-drainable oil and unusable fuel. 
 See Rotorcraft Flight Manual loading section for variations of fuel weight and moment- 
 arm with variations of fuel and fuel quantity."
NOTE 2,"The rotorcraft must be operated in accordance with the appropriate FAA-approved 
 Rotorcraft Flight Manual as required under “EQUIPMENT”. All placards required in the 
 FAA-approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual must be installed in the rotorcraft. The following 
 placard must be displayed in front of and in clear view of the pilots: 
 “THIS HELICOPTER MUST BE OPERATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 
 OPERATING 
 LIMITATIONS 
 SPECIFIED 
 IN 
 THE 
 FAA 
 APPROVED 
 ROTORCRAFT FLIGHT MANUAL.” 
 All placards listed in the approved flight manual must be installed in the specified 
 locations."
NOTE 3,"Information essential to the proper maintenance of the rotorcraft is contained in the 
 Sikorsky S-92A Maintenance Manual, SA S92A-AMM-000 and in the Airworthiness 
 Limitations and Inspection Requirements Manual, SA S92A-AWL-000. The Airworthiness 
 Limitations and Inspection Requirements for gross weights above 26,500 pounds are 
 contained in document number SIC920010 (see Note 16). The values of retirement 
 (service) life are contained in Chapter 4 of the Airworthiness Limitations and Inspection 
 Requirements Manual in documents SA S92A-AWL-000 and SIC920010 (if applicable). 
 The values of retirement (service) life cannot be changed without FAA Engineering 
 approval. Manuals SA S92A-AMM-000 and SA S92A-AWL-000 are provided with each 
 helicopter. Manual SIC920010 is provided with helicopters with the 27,700 lb. Gross 
 Weight Expansion option."
NOTE 4,"The term “Unlimited Life” is defined as 30,000 flight hours for the Model S-92A rotorcraft. 
 Operation of individual aircraft beyond 30,000 flight hours is contingent upon a Life 
 Extension Program approved by FAA Engineering"
NOTE 5,"The model S-92A rotorcraft employs electronic engine controls that are recognized to be 
 more susceptible to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) than manual (non-electronic) 
 controls used on other rotorcraft. EMI may be the result of radiated or conducted 
 interference. For this reason, modifications that add or change systems that have the 
 potential for EMI, must either be qualified to an FAA acceptable standard or tested at the 
 time of installation for interference to the engine controls. This type of testing must employ 
 the particular engine control’s diagnostic techniques and external diagnostic techniques. 
 This testing must be accomplished in accordance with an FAA Engineering approved 
 alternate test plan."
NOTE 6,"Seating arrangements for 19 passengers maximum have been approved by the FAA. With 
 these seating arrangements, seats located along the aisle way shall not have armrests 
 installed on the aisle way side of any aisle seat unless the aisle way seat armrest 
 incorporates an armrest hold down feature. Installation of the Observer Seat and/or 
 Passenger Seat located on the forward starboard bulkhead is prohibited with the 
 installation of the Lower Search/Rescue Door. Occupancy of the Passenger Seat located 
 on the forward starboard bulkhead is prohibited if Observer Seat is installed. Carriage of 
 passengers is prohibited with the installation of the Lower Search/Rescue Door. These 
 seating arrangements are shown in the Loading Information section of the FAA-approved 
 Rotorcraft Flight Manual. Additional optional seating arrangements or related passenger 
 provisions may be approved in accordance with the Type Certificate Basis."

 Rotorcraft Flight Manual for Cold Weather Procedures."
NOTE 10,"External lift operations utilizing the cargo hook include Heavy External Lift and Light 
 External Lift. Heavy and Light External Lift limitations are defined in the Rotorcraft Flight 
 Manual and the Airworthiness Limitations and Inspection Requirements Manual."
NOTE 11,"For flight in icing conditions, aircraft must be equipped with Rotorcraft Ice Protection 
 System (RIPS) and Rotorcraft Flight Manual as shown in FAA Approved Sikorsky 
 document SA S92A-FMCD-000, Revision 5 and subsequent. For flight into icing 
 conditions, RIPS must be turned on. RIPS equipped aircraft are not approved for flight in 
 icing conditions above 10,000 ft pressure altitude, or for flight in freezing rain, freezing 
 drizzle or Supercooled Large Drop (SLD) icing conditions."
NOTE 12,"Any modifications, alterations, or other changes to the exterior of the aircraft that may affect 
 the operation or function of the RIPS system, or create an area or surface for ice collection 
 that may be released in flight, must be approved by FAA Engineering to allow the approval 
 of flight in icing conditions to be continued."
NOTE 13,"The S-92A rotorcraft has not been certified for Category A vertical takeoffs and landings 
 from an elevated heliport."
