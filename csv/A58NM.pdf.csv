 Import Requirements 
 The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed 
 by a representative of the exporting foreign civil airworthiness authority on behalf of the European Community. The Export C of 
 conform with the Type Design approved under U.S. Type Certificate No. A58NM, and is in a condition for safe operation. 
 Compliance with Airworthiness Directives (ADs) has been checked only for ADs issued by EASA, ADs adopted by EASA and 
 ADs published by FAA’ 
 At the time of the first airplane import the latest approved Revision of each Airworthiness Limitation Section (ALS) listed under 
 the Note 3 must be incorporated in the maintenance program. After the first airplane import the later revision of an ALS will be 
 mandated by Airworthiness Directive 
 In order for the FAA to determine that an A380 aircraft is in a condition for safe operation under the provisions of 14 CFR 
 FAA Transport Airplane Directorate; 1601 Lind Avenue Southwest; Renton, Washington 98055; telephone (425) 227-1263; fax 
 (425) 227-1149, prior to issuance of the U.S. airworthiness certificate to obtain the FAA Required Airworthiness Action List 
 (RAAL) for the A380. After the first airplane is imported to the U.S. the RAAL will be finalized and published in the TCDS. 
 When the TCDS is amended to include the RAAL, a notice will be published in the Federal Register, to inform the public of this 
 amendment 
 Safety Agency (EASA), which is the state of design authority for the Airbus A380, to be required to correct unsafe conditions 
 discovered on the original type design of the A380. EASA has issued Airworthiness Directives that require the accomplishment 
 of these modifications and inspections to correct the identified unsafe conditions, and has advised the FAA of this mandatory 
 continuing airworthiness information (MCAI). Based on this MCAI the FAA has determined that the airworthiness actions 
 identified in the EASA ADs listed in Model A380 RAAL are required in the interest of safety and are necessary for this airplane 
 to be in a condition for safe operation. 
 Prior to issuance of a Standard Airworthiness Certificate on any Airbus A380 model aircraft, all airworthiness actions listed in the 
 Model A380 RAAL must be accomplished in accordance with the compliance times listed in each MCAI, except as noted in the 
 RAAL. The MCAI listed in the RAAL are airworthiness limitations in addition to those listed in note 3 of this TCDS, and must 
 be included in the operator’s airplane maintenance or inspection program. All inspections or modifications, required by the 
 EASA MCAI, that have surpassed the initial compliance time, must be accomplished prior to issuance of the Standard 
 Airworthiness Certificate 
 Any deviation from the requirements of the MCAIs, listed in the RAAL, must be approved by the Manager, International Branch, 
 ANM116 FAA Transport Airplane Directorate 
 A Notice of Policy Statement announcing the FAA’s policy with respect to foreign MCAI, when no aircraft of the affected design 
 are currently registered in the U.S. was published in the Federal Register on May 1, 1998, docket 98-11648. Additional guidance
