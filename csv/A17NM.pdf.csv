Note 1,"The airplane as certified in the Restricted Category with a Gross Weight for Take-off 3800 lbs, for day VFR 
 Operations only. Operations into known or forecast icing conditions prohibited. 
 The handling and stability qualities of the aircraft have been examined at weights up to but not beyond the 
 Australian Agricultural Gross Weight for Take-off of 4250 lb., as scheduled in the performance data given in 
 the ‘Pilot’s Handling Notes’. However, operation of the airplane at Gross Weights in excess of 3800 lbs. is 
 not approved by the FAA for U.S. registered aircraft. 
 Since the hopper load is disposable, landings at weights of 3800 lbs. should not be required. 
 Pilots should exercise caution in handling the aircraft at weights beyond the Gross Weight for Take-off and 
 should restrict speeds and maneuver load factors to prevent over-stressing the aircraft structure."
Note 2,"Current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight and
