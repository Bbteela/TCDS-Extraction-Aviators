 See Note 8, Note 9 and Note 10"
Import Requirements,"a) A United States airworthiness certificate (JAR-VLA Special Class) may be issued 
 on the basis of a Polish Certificate of Airworthiness for Export signed by a 
 representative of the Civil Aviation Office (CAO) on behalf of the European 
 Community, containing the following statement (in the English language): ‘The 
 aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to comply 
 with U.S. airworthiness regulations 14 CFR Federal Aviation Regulations Part 
 21.17(b), type certificate No. A61CE, and to be in a condition for safe operation.’ 
 b) The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated 
 under FAR Section 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is 
 FAR Sections 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). 
 c) Serial numbers AT3-026 through AT3-055 must have the rudder flight control 
 system modified per paragraph 3.2 of Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB) 
 ATB3.03.B, Issue 1, dated February 5, 2010 (EASA AD 2010-0025-E) before U.S. 
 standard airworthiness can be issued. (See Note 9) 
 d) For all serial numbers airplanes, inspect to determine if the airplane is equipped 
 with ELPROP 3-1-1P propellers with propeller serial numbers 3E.001 to 3E.088, 
 inclusively. If one these propellers are installed, accomplish the initial inspection 
 and modification, if uncracked, and replacement of the propeller, if found cracked, 
 per AERO Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB) No. EPB.01.B Issue 1 dated May 14 
 2009 (EASA AD 2009-0134-E). This must be accomplished before the U.S. 
 standard airworthiness can be issued. (See Note 10) 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the 
 United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to 
 identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate 
 of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating 
 exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 
 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an 
 airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft."
