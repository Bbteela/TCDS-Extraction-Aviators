 NOTE 2 
 All placards required in the approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) must be installed in the appropriate 
 location. 
 NOTE 3 
 Mandatory retirement time for all fuselage structural components for Models 100, A100 (U-21F), A100A and 
 B100 is 20,000 hours’ time in service. However, the Fuselage Life may be unlimited if the airplane is 
 maintained and inspected at the required intervals specified in Chapter 5 (or Chapter 4 or Airworthiness 
 Limitations Section, as appropriate) of the Airplane’s Maintenance Manual. 
 Mandatory retirement time for Models 99, 99A, A99A and B99 wing center section lower forward spar cap 
 and both right and left outer panel lower forward spar caps including wing attachment fittings is as specified 
 in the applicable Airworthiness Directive, or for airplanes having complied with Beechcraft Service 
 Instruction 0986, the FAA Approved AFM. Mandatory retirement times for all Model C99 structural 
 components are contained in the Pilot's Operating Handbook and FAA Approved AFM (P/N 99-590030-3) 
 Limitations Section. These limitations may not be changed without FAA Engineering approval. 
 Mandatory replacement time for Model 100, A100 and B100; serials B-1 and on, BE-1 and on all wing 
 attach bolts and nuts is 15 years or 15, 000 hours, whichever occurs first; subsequent replacement times are 
 the same as initial intervals as noted.

NOTE 5,"Flight idle propeller low pitch stop is set so that at 2000 rpm, torque shall be an indicated 600 +60 ft.-lb. 
 corrected for sea level standard day. Secondary flight idle stop shall be 210 +40 propeller rpm higher than 
 flight idle stop with a gas generator speed of 70 percent (Models 99, 99A, 100, 99A(FACH), A99, A99A and 
 B99). 
 Flight idle propeller low pitch stop is set so that at 2000 rpm torque shall be an indicated 600 +40 ft.-lb. 
 corrected for sea level standard day (Model C99). 
 Flight propeller low pitch stop is set so that at 2000 rpm torque shall be an indicated 660 +60 ft.-lb. corrected 
 for sea level standard day. Secondary flight and ground low pitch stop shall set so that at 2000 rpm torque 
 shall be an indicated 440 +60 ft.-lb. corrected for sea level standard day (Models A100 and A100A)."
NOTE 6,"Prior to civil certification, Model 99A(FACH) airplanes, S/N U-137 through U-145, which have been 
 operated by the Chilean Air Force, must be modified per Beech Dwg. 99-002010. 
 Model 99, S/N U-36, U-80 through U-145 and U-147 are eligible for installation of PT6A-27 engines at the 
 Beech factory and when so modified must be identified as Model 99A. 
 Model 99A airplanes may be modified to the A99A configuration by field or factory incorporation of Beech 
 Kit 99-5008-1. 
 Model 99 airplanes may be modified to the A99 configuration by field or factory incorporation of Beech Kit 
 99-5008."
NOTE 7,"Emergency use of MIL-G-5572 fuel (Models 99, 99A, A99, A99A, B99, C99, 100, A100, A100A): 
 Grades 80/87, 91/98, 100/130 and 115/145 are permitted for a total time period not to exceed 150 hours 
 during any overhaul period. It is not necessary to purge the unused fuel from the system when switching fuel 
 types. 
 Emergency use of MIL-G-5572D fuel (Model B100): 
 Use of MIL-G-5572D, 80/87 only, aviation gasoline permitted not to exceed 1,000 gallons per engine for 
 each 100 hours of engine operation. Log book entry required. Icing inhibitor MIL-I-2768E fuel additive 
 approved not to exceed 0.15 percent by volume."
NOTE 8,"PT6A-27 and -28 engines may be intermixed on the 99, 99A, B99, and A99A. PT6A-28 engine should be 
 modified with the -27 rear scavenge oil tee and hose."
NOTE 9,"Model 99 and 99A aircraft may increase their gross weight to 10,900 pounds and increase their performance 
 limitations in accordance with FAA AFM 99-590019-13 when modified per Beech Kits 99-5014-1 or 95- 
 5014-3. When modified, the limitations in Section VI of the TCDS appropriate to Model B99 will apply."
NOTE 10,"The two (2) propeller models used on the Model C99 differ only in the manner in which the feather angle is 
 adjusted. The HC-B3TN-3B propeller has an internal feather adjustment and must be partially disassembled 
 to reset the feather angle. The HC-B3TN-3M hub has an external adjustment feature and need not be 
 disassembled to reset the feather angle."
