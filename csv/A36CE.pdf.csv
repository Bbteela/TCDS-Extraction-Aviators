 Aircraft must be modified in accordance with Central Air Services, Inc. Drawing List No. 
 1000 dated March 15, 1982, special purpose of forest service fire fighting which is incidental 
 to the business of the airplane owner which is other than air transport. 
 Aircraft certificated under this type certificate are not eligible for multiple airworthiness 
 certification under FAR 21.187 unless it has been modified to conform to TC A762."
Production basis,"None - Prior to original certification of each aircraft an FAA representative must perform an 
 inspection for workmanship, materials, and conformity with the approved technical data. 
 characteristics."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable Airworthiness Regulations (See 
 Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. The FAA Approved 
 Airplane Flight Manual Supplement for Forest Service Fire Fighting is required in addition to 
 the operating limitations specified in Section V of the following: 
 T.O. 1C-54D-1 dated August 30, 1963, with change dated November 1, 1965, is applicable 
 to all C-54 series airplanes. 
 T.O. 1C-C54A-1 for the C-54A 
 T.O. 1C-C54B-1 for the C-54B 
 T.O. 1C-C54D-1 for the C-54D

a,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and 
 loading instructions, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter"
b,"""System Fuel and Oil,"" which must be included in the empty weight, is that amount required to fill both 
 systems and the tanks up to the tank outlets to the engines, when the airplane is in the level attitude. The 
 propeller feathering oil is not considered usable oil, and is included in the ""System Fuel and Oil."" The nacelle 
 oil tank capacities shown in this specification include only the usable oil for which the tanks are to be"
NOTE 2,The following placards shall be placed on the instrument panel in full view of the pilot:
a,"""This airplane shall be operated in accordance with U.S. Air Force Technical Order** and the Airplane Flight 
 Manual Supplement. T.O. 1C-54D-1 dated August 30, 1963, with change dated November 1, 1965, is 
 applicable to all C-54 series airplanes."
b,"ground running, avoid operation between 1550 and 1800 R.P.M. when the blades are off the low pitch stops."""
a,"The movable parts of the flap well may be secured in the closed position by disconnecting the flap actuating 
 linkage and safetying the actuator mechanism in the closed position."
b,"The elevator bungee may be deleted provided the C.G. is maintained between 16% MAC (381.4) to 32% 
 MAC (407.6). Extended C.G. range not allowed without bungee installed as per Douglas instructions."
NOTE 4,"Prior to certification in accordance with Type Certificate (TC) A762, the requirements for certification as outlined"
in the following listed reports for the particular model must be complied with:,
"Because the requirements for original certification are different for each model, the original model designation",
"is installed. (See ""Optional Equipment"" items in A762 for each model for alternate engine installations.)",
NOTE 5,"When fuselage oil tanks are removed, the airplane must be placarded to avoid carrying more than 2400 gallons of 
 fuel when the nacelle oil tanks are filled to their total usable capacity of 80 gallons, thereby insuring a fuel oil ratio 
 of not over 30 to 1. The auxiliary fuel tanks should be placarded for the quantity of gasoline not to exceed the 
 difference between 2400 gallons and the total capacity of the main fuel tanks. On aircraft which have only the four 
 center wing integral tanks and with not more than one fuselage fuel tank installed, the fuselage oil tank may be 
 removed and the above placard will not be necessary."
