Serial Nos eligible,"The Registro Aeronautico Italiano Certificate of Airworthiness for Export endorsed as noted 
 under ""Certification basis"" must be submitted for each individual helicopter for which 
 application for certification is made."
Certification basis,"CAR 10. Type Certificate No. 7H3 issued August 18, 1960. 
 Date of Application for Type Certificate November 27, 1957. 
 Each helicopter and any replacement parts manufactured in Italy must be designated as 
 ""import"" and clearly labeled as such in accordance with CAR 10.30. 
 A U.S. airworthiness certificate may be issued on the basis of a Certificate of Airworthiness 
 for Export signed by a representative of the RAI containing the following statement: ""The 
 helicopter covered by this certificate has been examined and found to comply with U.S. Civil 
 Air Regulation Part 6, dated December 20, 1956, including Amendments 6-1and 6-2""."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations (See 
 Certification basis) must be installed in the helicopter for certification. 
 Approved equipment is shown in the Costruzioni Aeronautiche Giovanni Agusta RAI 
 Approved Master Equipment List for the Agusta-Bell Model AB-102 helicopter."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and loading 
 instructions when necessary, must be in each helicopter at the time of original certification and at all times there- 
 after. In order to obtain the most consistent weight and balance results, all model helicopters should be weighed 
 on jackpoints rather than on skids. When changes are made to the helicopter which effect the weight and balance 
 refer to the Flight Manual for instructions. The certificated empty weight and corresponding C.G. location must 
 include unusable fuel of 30 pound (-22.1) which cannot be used safely in all flight attitudes and undrainable oil of 
 12 lb. (+16.0)."
NOTE 2,"The following placard must be installed on the instrument panel in full view of the pilot: 
 ""This helicopter must be operated in compliance with the operating limitations specified in the RAI approved 
 rotorcraft Flight Manual."" 
 For additional placards, see the RAI approved rotorcraft Flight Manual."
NOTE 3,"The retirement times of critical parts are listed in the following table. 
 These values of retirement or service life cannot be increased without FAA approval.
