Serial Nos Eligible,"The French Government ""Certificat de Navigabilite pour Exportation"" 
 endorsed as noted below under ""Import Requirements"" must be submitted for each 
 individual aircraft for which application for FAA certification is made."
Certification Basis,"FAR 21.29 and FAR 29 effective February 1, 1965 plus Amendments 29-1 through 
 29-9 and para. 29.1401(d) and (f) of Amendment 29-11, plus FAA Special Conditions 
 No. 29-68-EU-20 dated March 30, 1976. 
 Type Certificate No. H8EU issued March 31, 1976. 
 Date of Application for Type Certificate: June 26, 1974. 
 The French Direction Generale de l’Aviation Civile (DGAC) originally type 
 certificated this rotorcraft under its type certificate TC 80. The FAA validated 
 this product under U.S. Type Certificate Number H8EU. Effective September 
 28, 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this 
 product on behalf of the DGAC."
Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on a National Aviation 
 Authority (NAA) Export Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by 
 a representative of the French Generale de l’Aviation Civile (DGAC) on behalf 
 of the European Community. 
 The Export C of A should contain the following statement: “The aircraft 
 covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to comply with 
 the type design approved under U.S. Type Certificate Number H8EU and to be 
 in a condition for safe operation.”"
Service Information,"AEROSPATIALE Service Bulletins are approved by DGAC (formerly SGAC) and 
 include a statement to that effect. Such approval may be interpreted as approved by 
 FAA. 
 Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the 
 European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before 
 September 28, 2003 – by the French Generale de l’Aviation Civile (DGAC). 
 Any such documents are accepted by the FAA and are considered FAA 
 approved. 
 • 
 Service Bulletin, 
 • 
 Structural repair manuals, 
 • 
 Vendor manuals, 
 • 
 Aircraft flight manuals, and 
 • 
 Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 This applies only to the acceptance of the type design data. 
 required and optional equipment for the helicopter, except electronics. Report No. 360A.04.3210 lists 
 electronic communication and navigation equipment. 
 In addition, the following item of equipment is required: 
 SGAC (now DGAC)-approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual, Code B, approved December 18, 1975, 
 including Revision No. 1, approved February 1976. 
 (Date 2.76)."
Note 1,"Current weight and balance report including loading instructions and list of equipment included in the 
 certificated empty weight, must be provided for each helicopter at the time of original certification. The 
 certification empty weight and corresponding center of gravity location must include unusable fuel of 
 22.0 lb, at 137.7 in. 
 In order to obtain the most consistent weight and balance results, all helicopters should be weighed on 
 jackpoints rather than on wheels and floats. When changes are made to the helicopter which affect the 
 weight and balance, refer to the Flight Manual Weight and Balance Appendix for instructions. 
 All placards indicated in the Rotorcraft Flight Manual must be installed in the appropriate location."
Note 2,"Information essential to the proper maintenance of the helicopter is contained in the Manufacturer's 
 SA-360C Maintenance Manual provided with each helicopter. Life-limited components and associated 
 retirement times are presented in Chapter 5, Section CD 5.99, and must be replaced in accordance 
 therewith."
