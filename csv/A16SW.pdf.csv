 must be approved in accordance with the requirements defined in the special condition. 
 The damage tolerance requirements in the special condition are specified in terms of cabin altitude time history, 
 which is a function of the cabin leak rate. For model 400A the specified cabin altitude time history requirement 
 can be met with a pressure vessel opening of 1.0 square inches (assuming an emergency descent). The 
 determination of an equivalent crack length will depend upon the particular location of the crack, the pressure 
 vessel configuration in that location, and the direction of the crack, etc. The approval of modifications and/or 
 repairs must take into account the requirements of the special condition and how they apply to the particular 
 location and configuration being modified or repaired. The resulting inspection program must also consider 
 other applicable structural criteria."
