 ADRC-§25.21(g)(1) (737-8/-9) / 25.21(g)(2) (737-8200) [Amdt 25-NA] - Proof of compliance 
 Each requirement of this subpart, except §25.121(a), 25.123(c), 25.143(b)(1) and (b)(2), 25.149, 25.201(a)*, 25.201(c)(2), 
 25.203(c), 25.239, and 25.251(b) through (e), must be met in icing conditions. Section 25.207(c) and (d) must be met in the 
 landing configuration in icing conditions, but need not be met for other configurations. Compliance must be shown using the 
 atmospheric icing conditions defined in Appendix C at Amendment 25-0 and the ice accretions defined as additional 
 requirements under § C25.1, assuming normal operation of the airplane and its ice protection system in accordance with the 
 operating limitations and operating procedures provided in the Airplane Flight Manual. 
 For §25.201(a) stalls must be shown in straight flight with power off and power on in icing conditions."
ADRC§25125b2iiB Amdt 25NA  Landing,"(1) In icing conditions, VREF may not be less than 1.23 VSR0 with the holding ice accretion if the icing stall speed exceeds the 
 stall speed for non-icing conditions by the greater of 5 knots or 5% of VSR0. 
 (2) A low-speed aural warning must be provided for additional flight crew awareness of approaching a potential stall 
 condition, if the airspeed decreases below the minimum maneuver speed."
ADRC§25143j Amdt 25NA  General,"For flight in icing conditions before the ice protection system has been activated and is performing its intended function, it 
 must be demonstrated in flight with ice accretions that: 
 ADRC-§25.207(e) [Amdt 25-108] - Stall Warnings 
 In straight flight, there should be no reduction in the stall warning margin above the stall speed in icing conditions from that 
 required for the clean airplane (3% stall warning margin for all flap settings). The distinctiveness of the stall warning should 
 be that required for the stall warning of the clean airplane. 
 ADRC-§25.253(c) [Amdt 25-NA] - High-speed characteristics 
 For stability characteristics, the following maneuvers must be shown: 
 (1) Windup turn at 270 knots 
 (2) Roll response at 200 knots 
 (3) General handling qualities at 220 knots 
 (4) Dutch roll maneuver at 250 knots 
 (5) Speed stability at 280 knots 
 ADRC-§25.365(e)(l) [Amdt 25-NA] - Pressurized Compartment Loads 
 In lieu of the following compliance criteria, compliance to§ 25.365(e)(1), Amendment 25-87, may be shown: 
 Any structure, component or part, inside or outside a pressurized compartment, the failure of which could interfere with 
 continued safe flight and landing, must be designed to withstand the effects of a sudden release of pressure through an 
 820 in2 opening in any compartment at any operating altitude. 
 ADRC-§25.795(c)(2) [Amdt 25-NA] - Security Considerations"
"The Boeing Model 737-8, 737-9, and 737-8200 was granted an exception per 14 CFR 21.101(b) for § 25.795(c)(2) based on 
 the demonstration and justification that security features were present in the type design. These security features must be in 
 consideration in any subsequent type design change, modification, or repair to ensure the level of safety designed into the 
 737-8, 737-9, and 737-8200 is maintained. In lieu of the following, compliance to § 25.795(c)(2), Amendment 25-127, may 
 be shown 
 Modifications that reduce flight critical system separation or adversely impact survivability of systems are not acceptable. 
 ADRC-§25.841(a)(2)(i) [Amdt 25-NA] - Pressurized Cabins 
 When evaluating the compliance to §25.841(a)(2)(i), the airplane must be analyzed in accordance with the conditions 
 identified below. In lieu of the following, compliance to § 25.841(a)(2)(i) Amendment 25-87, may be shown: 
 1 
 The cabin altitude time exposure to 25,000 feet must not be greater than 146 seconds (737-8/-8200) or 161 seconds 
 (737-9). 
 2 
 Analytically predicted time must be validated in flight test. 
 ADRC-§ 25.903(e) [Amdt 25-100] – Engines 
 The following design details or information must be maintained to ensure that an unsafe design condition is not present as 
 required by § 2121b2 
 Ignition System 
 The engine in-flight start demonstration flight test conditions should be performed using the most critical single ignition 
 configuration. The configuration(s) selected should be based on a consideration of the most critical igniter position, the 
 most critical applicable ignition power configuration, the most critical igniter plug adjustment, and any other relevant 
 factors 
 InFlight AllEngine Restart 
 A minimum restart capability after an all-engines-out scenario must be established under the following conditions using 
 procedures provided in the airplane flight manual (AFM): 
 a. During the take-off and the initial climb-out portion of the flight, the airplane should have the capability for the 
 flightcrew to restore engine power immediately following an all-engine-out scenario and when the fuel source to the 
 engine is restored. 
 b. During the high altitude portion of the flight at cruise speed and maximum altitude, the airplane should have the 
 capability for the flightcrew to restart engines from a stabilized windmill speed prior to descending below an altitude of 
 15,000 feet, by showing either or both: 
 1) All but one engine should be restarted and accelerated to produce maximum continuous thrust/power, or 
 2) The engine(s) should be restarted, and the necessary thrust/power achieved, to enable the airplane to maintain 
 level flight. 
 c. During flight at speeds greater than the minimum flaps-up “holding speed” and at altitudes below 20,000 feet, the 
 airplane should have the capability for the flightcrew to restart engines from a stabilized windmill speed prior to 
 descending 5000 feet from the initiation of the restart procedure and prior to exceeding an airspeed of 300 knots, by 
 showing either or both: 
 1) All but one engine should be restarted and accelerated to produce maximum continuous thrust/power, or 
 2) The engine(s) should be restarted, and the necessary thrust/power achieved, to enable the airplane to maintain 
 level flight. 
 The following design features must be incorporated in the type design (reference § 25.1141, Amendment N/A). In lieu of the 
 following, compliance to 25.1141, Amendment 25-115, may be shown. 
 1 
 Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) spar mounted fuel shut off valve must be controlled and position monitored by the APU 
 engine control unit including fault indication in the flight deck if the valve does not reach its commanded position and 
 maintenance fault reporting. A dedicated indication for the fuel valve position is not required in the flight deck. 
 2 
 Control of the fuel valve position is accomplished by the APU electronic control unit (ECU) for normal operation (Note 
 that § 25.1141(f)(1) is met by the physical position of the APU Master switch ON (valve selected open) or OFF (valve 
 selected closed) located in the flight deck). 
 a) During the APU start sequence, the fuel valve must be commanded closed by the APU ECU until it indicates closed 
 (it is likely already closed from the previous shutdown), then it is commanded open. The starter is not energized 
 until the valve indicates open. 
 b) At start, APU BITE will detect a valve that fails to open or close. 
 c) The fuel valve must be commanded closed at shutdown. 
 d) At shutdown, APU BITE will detect a valve that fails to close. 
 ADRC-§25.1317(a) [Amdt 25-NA] - High-intensity radiated fields (HIRF) protection 
 Special condition 25-ANM-132(1) is an applicable requirement. 
 DAL A (737-8/-9) / HLCL A (737-8200) Equipment HIRF Design Criteria: 
 RF susceptibility testing was performed per FAA HIRF special condition 25-ANM-132(1). Per the special condition, 
 testing was performed to set levels. In addition, RF susceptibility testing (radiated and conducted) was performed to 
 HIRF certification levels (shown in the table below) as attenuated by the airframe. Airframe attenuation testing was 
 performed to verify that the test levels used were sufficient.

 ADRC-§25.1322(b)(2), (c)(3) [Amdt 25-NA] – Flight crew alerting 
 (b) Alerts must conform to the following prioritization hierarchy based on the urgency of flightcrew awareness and 
 response.

 ADRC-14 CFR Part 25 Appendix C §C25.1 [Amdt 25-0] 
 (1) Ice accretions--General. The most critical takeoff or holding ice accretion in terms of airplane performance and handling 
 qualities must be used to show compliance with the applicable airplane performance and handling requirements in icing 
 conditions of Subpart B of this part. The full range of atmospheric icing conditions of this appendix must have been 
 conditions (for example, configuration, speed, angle-of-attack, and altitude). The ice accretions to be considered are 
 defined as follows 
 (a) Takeoff ice is the most critical ice accretion on unprotected surfaces, and any ice accretion on the protected surfaces 
 appropriate to normal ice protection system operation, between liftoff and either 1,500 feet above the takeoff surface, 
 or the height at which the transition from the takeoff to the en route configuration is completed and VFTO is 
 reached, whichever is higher. 
 (b) Holding ice is the critical ice accretion on the unprotected surfaces, and any ice accretion on the protected surfaces 
 appropriate to normal ice protection system operation, during the holding flight phase. 
 (2) In order to reduce the number of ice accretions, holding ice accretions may be used for any other flight phase. 
 (3) The ice accretion that has the most adverse effect on handling qualities may be used for airplane performance tests 
 provided any difference in performance is conservatively taken into account. 
 (4) For both unprotected and protected parts, the ice accretion for the takeoff phase may be determined by calculation, 
 assuming that 
 (b) The ice accretion starts at liftoff; 
 (c) The critical ratio of thrust/power-to-weight; 
 (d) Failure of the critical engine occurs at VEF; and 
 (e) Crew activation of the ice protection system is in accordance with a normal operating procedure provided in the 
 Airplane Flight Manual, except that after beginning the takeoff roll, it must be assumed that the crew takes no action 
 to activate the ice protection system until the airplane is at least 400 feet above the takeoff surface. 
 (5) The ice accretion before the ice protection system has been activated and is performing its intended function can be 
 represented by the WTAI failure ice accretions on the unprotected and normally protected surfaces (nominally 3 inches 
 and 15 inches respectively
