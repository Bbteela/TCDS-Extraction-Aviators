 The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an Export Certificate of 
 Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the Spanish DGAC on behalf 
 of the European Community. The Export C of A should contain the following statement: 
 ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to conform 
 with the Type Design approved under U.S. Type Certificate No. A43EU and to be in a 
 condition for safe operation.’ 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the 
 United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to 
 identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate 
 of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating 
 exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to FAA
