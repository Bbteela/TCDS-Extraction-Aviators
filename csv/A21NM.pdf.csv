 A Spanish DGAC Certificate of Airworthiness for Export endorsed as noted under"
Serial Nos Eligible,"“Import Requirements” below must be submitted for each individual airplane for which 
 application for United States certification is made."
Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an Export Certificate of 
 Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the Spanish DGAC on 
 behalf of the European Community. The Export C of A should contain the 
 following statement: ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, 
 tested, and found to conform with the Type Design approved under U.S. Type 
 Certificate No. A21NM and to be in a condition for safe operation.’ 
 Only CN235 airplane manufactured in Spain and accompanied by a Spanish export 
 certificate of airworthiness are eligible for a United States Airworthiness Certificate. 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the 
 United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to 
 identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate 
 of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating 
 exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to FAA 
 Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance

 condition for safe operation.’ 
 “Only CN-235-200 airplanes manufactured in each Spain and accompanied by a 
 Spanish export certificate of airworthiness are eligible for a United States 
 Airworthiness Certificate.” 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness 
 (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity

Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an Export Certificate of 
 Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the Spanish DGAC on behalf 
 of the European Community. The Export C of A should contain the following statement: 
 ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to conform 
 with the Type Design approved under U.S. Type Certificate No. A21NM and to be in a 
 condition for safe operation.’ 
 “Only CN-235-300 airplanes manufactured in Spain and accompanied by a Spanish export 
 certificate of airworthiness are eligible for a United States Airworthiness Certificate.” 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness (or 
 equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of

 NOTES 
 NOTE 1 
 Weight and Balance: 
 (a) A current Weight and Balance must be in each aircraft at the time of original airworthiness 
 certification and at all time thereafter except in the case of an operator having an FAA approved 
 loading system for weight and balance control. 
 (b) The airplane must be loaded in accordance with Section 2 of the approved Airplane 
 Flight Manual and the C.G. must be within the specified limits at all times. 
 NOTE 2 
 Airplane operation must be in accordance with the airplane Flight Manual (AFM) listed above. All 
 placards required in either the approved AFM, the applicable operating rules, or the certification basis 
 must be installed in the airplane. 
 NOTE 3 
 Required structural inspections, inspections times and retirement times for structural parts and for 
 components are listed in the Airworthiness Limitation as presented in section 1.4 of Construcciones 
 Aeronauticas, S.A. Document No. D.T. 5-C-99-5008. 
 NOTE 4 
 Engine certification maintenance requirements (CMR) and systems certification maintenance 
 requirements are included in section 1.4.1. of Construcciones Aeronauticas, S.A. Document No. 
 D.T. 5-C-99-5008. 
 NOTE 5 
 On December 20, 2000, the DGAC submitted a statement (Ref. No: 61/C-255/00-354 ) that the C- 
 295 design complies with FAR §25.723 based on analysis of the CASA C-295 Main Landing Gear 
 and Nose Landing Gear shock absorption tests, contingent on the inclusion of modification S30429. 
 The FAA has accepted the DGAC’s statement of compliance, and finds the CASA C-295 aircraft 
 complies with FAR §25.723. Consequently the CASA Model C-295 Type Certificate, with Type 
 Design Document (Master Drawing List) DT-98-3308 Rev C and modification S30429 will be valid 
 after December 31, 2000, the date of expiration for Partial Grant of Exemption No. 7088. 
 Accordingly, all CASA Model C-295 aircraft certificated in the United States must include 
 modification S30429.
