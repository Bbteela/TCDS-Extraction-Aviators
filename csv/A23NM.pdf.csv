Certification Basis,"Type Certificate A23NM, issued August 17, 1988, for the special purpose of carriage of 
 cargo. Reference to Advisory Circular 21.17, dated March 14, 1982, specifies that 
 carriage of cargo is considered a special purpose under FAR 21.25(b)(7). Date of 
 application December 8, 1986. The modifications incorporated are considered 
 appropriate to the special purpose operation. The criteria established in Civil 
 Regulations Part 4b appropriate to the special purpose operation has been used to 
 evaluate these particular changes and demonstrate that the original level of airworthiness 
 established by the military requirements has not been reduced. A Finding of No 
 Significant Impact (FONSI) for the modified Grumman (Navy) Model HU-16C (UF-1) 
 aircraft has been accomplished and approved on March 21, 1988. A finding under the 
 applicable provisions of the Noise Control Act of 1972 has also been accomplished and 
 approved on March 21, 1988, for the modified Grumman HU-16C (UF-1) aircraft 
 (Restricted Category- Military Surplus)."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed. In addition, NAVWEPS Flight Manual
