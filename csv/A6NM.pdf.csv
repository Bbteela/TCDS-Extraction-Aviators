Serial Numbers Eligible,Surplus military C-123K airplanes that have been found
See Note 1A and 1B,to comply with the requirements of this data sheet.
Certification Basis,"The certification basis is FAR 21.25(a)(2) and (b)(7) dated May 1974, 
 Amendment 21-1 through 21-54. 
 The aircraft has been modified by Fairchild Hiller, 1967 per AF Contract 
 AF 09(603)-62815. 
 The aircraft has been modified to Reagan Report RDR-001, for the special purpose 
 of carrying enclosed/packaged cargo in areas specified in the FAA approved 
 operations specification where standard aircraft are not reasonably available to 
 carry enclosed/ packaged cargo and when the carriage of such cargo is incidental 
 to the business of the airplane owner, which is other than air transport."
Production Basis,"None - prior to original certification of each aircraft, an FAA representative 
 must perform an inspection for workmanship, materials, and conformity with 
 the approved technical data and assure that the applicant has conducted a 
 satisfactory flight test. All applicable TCTO's must be accomplished. 
 (Reference T.O. 1C- 123K-1)"
Equipment,The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable Airworthiness Regulations
See Note 6,"(See Certification Basis), must be installed in the aircraft for certification."
NOTE 1,"This approval applies to: 
 A. 
 Basic United States Air Force C-123K airplane with no major modifications except as required 
 by Reagan Report RDR-001, Revision N/C, Dated August 16, 1982, or later FAA Approved Revisions. 
 For operation at weights in excess of 60,000 pounds, the aircraft must be modified per Reagan Report 
 No. RDR-6400, Rev. N/C, or later FAA approved revision. 
 B. 
 Airplane certified for the special purpose of carrying enclosed/packaged cargo with the following limitations: 
 (1) 
 In addition to the operating limitations in this data sheet, area economic, passenger, and 
 other appropriate operating limitations in accordance with FAR 21.25 shall be shown on placards or 
 listings accessible to the pilot. 
 (2) 
 The following placard must be displayed in the C-123K airplane in front of and in clear view 
 of the pilot: 
 ""RESTRICTED CATEGORY"" 
 ""This airplane must be operated as a restricted category airplane in compliance with the 
 operating limitations stated in Section V of USAF T.O. 1C-123K and in the form of placards, markings, 
 and manuals. It is certified for the special purpose of carrying enclosed/packaged cargo in areas 
 specified in the FAA approved operations specification where standard aircraft are not reasonably 
 available to carry enclosed/packaged cargo and when the carriage of such cargo is incidental tot he 
 business of the airplane owner, which is other than air transport. All cargo must be loaded and 
 restrained in accordance with USAF T.O. 1C-123B-9."" 
 (3) 
 A red radial line required on the airspeed indicator at 245 knots. 
 (4) 
 Fuselage cargo compartments must be marked by a 1 inch wide white line from floor level to 60 inches 
 above the floor. Compartment markings must include compartment designation, compartment capacity 
 and the allowable floor loading for the compartment in accordance with USAF T.O. 1C-123B-5, Section 
 III. Compartment markings must be white letters at least 1 inch high and must be stenciled on the left 
 and right side walls of the fuselage between 30 and 60 inches above the floor. 
 (5) 
 Carriage of hazardous materials is prohibited unless compliance is shown with the applicable regulations 
 in the Code of Federal REgulations 49, Part 175."
NOTE 2,"Current weight and balance report and loading instructions must agree with Section II of USAF 
 T.O. 1C-123K-1 for the C-123K."
NOTE 3,The aircraft must be serviced and maintained in accordance with USAF T.O. 1C-123B-2-1.
NOTE 4,All cargo must be loaded and restrained in accordance with USAF T.O. 1C-123B-9.
NOTE 5,"The following note must be placed under ""Exceptions"" on all Export Certificates of Airworthiness for this aircraft. 
 ""This aircraft is type certificated in the restricted category and may not meet the applicable airworthiness code 
 as provided by Annex 8 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation."""
NOTE 6,"USAF T.O. 1C-123K-1 must be available in the C-123K aircraft for all flight operations. For operation at weights 
 between 60,000 and 64,000 pounds, Reagan Airplane Flight Manual Supplement No. RDR-64 is required."
NOTE 7,"Toe eliminate balancing difficulties, aluminum alloy propeller blades are currently being repaired and stock listed 
 in two categories. At time of overhaul of blade assemblies, blades are balanced against a master balancer meeting 
 new blade specifications. Blades meeting the specifications retain the original blade designation. Blades not 
 meeting this specification will have the master drawing number identified by prefix letter R stamped on the blade 
 butt. All R blades are mated, and the mate blade serial numbers are stenciled on the outside diameter of the blade 
 butt. The mated set of blades is packaged and issued as a set and will not balance with other blades. When 
 replacement blades are required, check the identification. When R blades are required, a complete set will be 
 ordered. All other blades are interchangeable and may be requisitioned as require. (Reference T.O. 3-1-1)"
NOTE 8,"Flight characteristics of 43E60 propellers incorporating 6917F-14 or 7159B-14 blades are identical and intermixing 
 propellers on same aircraft is permissible. Basic difference is 6917F has basic design airfoil thickness and square 
 top whereas the 7159B has increased airfoil thickness and round tip. Due to the difference in airfoil thickness and 
 tip design, the 6917F-14 and 7159B-14 blades will not be intermixed in the same propeller assembly. (Reference"
NOTE 9,"Maximum gross weight with no augmentation jets operating is 45,000 lbs."
