Production basis,Production Certificate No. 605
Required equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. Convair Report

 equipment that must be installed as well as optional equipment installations approved by 
 FAA."
Service information,"Convair Report CS-59-022, ""Convair 880 Structural Repair Manual"" and CS 61-041, 
 ""Convair Structural Repair Manual for the Model 22M"" is FAA Approved. Service 
 Bulletins and other service information, when FAA approved, will carry a statement to 
 that effect."
NOTE 1,"(a) Current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, 
 and loading instructions must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times 
 thereafter except in the case of operators having an approved weight control system. Convair Report 
 ZW-22-021- and ZW-22-029-, ""Convair Weight and Balance Report,"" are applicable to Models 22 and 
 22M, respectively. 
 (b) The airplane must be loaded so that the C.G. is within the specified limits at all times, with the effects of 
 fuel use, gear retraction and crew and passenger movement being considered. See ""C.G. Range"" for 
 restrictions on center of gravity limits for takeoff at gross weights below 130,000 lb. 
 (c) The weight of system fuel and oil as defined below and hydraulic fluid, all of which must be included in 
 the airplane empty weight, is listed in Convair Report ZM-22-062, ""Master Equipment List, Model 22. 
 System Fuel: The weight of all fuel required to fill all lines and tanks up to the zero fuel point on the 
 fuel gages in the most critical flight altitude. This includes the unusable tank fuel as defined by 
 CAR 4b.416. 
 System Oil Including Usable: The weight of oil remaining in the engine, constant speed drive, thrust 
 reverser, tanks and lines after subtracting the usable and reverser reserve oil from the total capacity. 
 These values are noted under ""Oil Capacity"" and must be added to the empty weight of the airplane. 
 (d) The ""Unusable"" fuel is the amount of fuel in the tanks which is unavailable to the engines under critical 
 flight conditions as defined by CAR 4b.416 and may be obtained by taking the difference between 
 ""total refuel"" and ""usable"" tank capacities shown under ""Fuel Capacity."" This ""unusable"" fuel is 
 included in System Fuel as indicated in 1(c) above. 
 (e) Fuel loading and usable procedures are dictated by structural design and to maintain airplane C.G. 
 within approved limits. Refer to Convair Report ZW-22-021- or ZW-22- 029-, the specific airplane 
 weight and balance reports, for loading, takeoff and landing fuel distribution limitations. 
 (f) Fuel Jettison: Fuel jettisoning must be available for operation of the airplane in excess of the maximum 
 landing weight. Refer to FAA Approved Airplane Flight manual for limitations to be observed during 
 fuel jettison operation. The unjettisonable fuel must be included in the airplane landing weight, and the 
 amount of usable fuel remaining in the tanks after complete jettisoning is as follows: 
 All Airplanes: 
 Outboard tanks (1 & 4) 3125 lb. ea. 
 Inboard tanks (2 & 3) 2825 lb. ea. 
 Weights are based on 7.0 lb. per U.S. Gallon."
NOTE 2,Reserved.
NOTE 3,"All replacement seats (crew, passenger and lounge), although they may comply with TSO-C39, must also be 
 demonstrated to comply with CAR 4b.358(c). Other installations, such as berths, buffets, compartments or 
 items of mass which could create a hazard to the safety of passengers and crew must also be demonstrated to 
 meet the same requirements."
NOTE 4,"The 22-1 and 22-2 are versions of the basic Model 22, the certification basis for which is Type Certificate 
 No. 4A27. These dash numbers were selected by Convair primarily for contractual and clerical purposes and 
 should not be considered to define different models of airplanes. One version may be converted to another 
 by incorporating pertinent required equipment and complete conformity with corresponding approved 
 drawings. 
 It should be noted that the identification plate in the cockpit identifies the specific airplane version and that 
 different Airplane Flight Manuals, primarily the result of different autopilot installations, air conditioning 
 system, and electrical system, are applicable. Accordingly, when converting from one version to another, the 
 identification plate must be suitably revised. The Flight Manual pertinent to the new version must also be 
 installed."

 to the FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manuals CS 59-019 and CS 59-061 for the Model 22-1 and 22-2
