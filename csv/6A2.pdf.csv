 certification and at all times thereafter (except in the case of air carrier operators having 
 an approved weight control system). Manufacturer's Master Equipment List contains list 
 of approved equipment in addition to equipment listed in this specification. 
 (b) ""System Fuel and Oil"" (See Item 102), which must be included in the empty weight, is that 
 amount required to fill both systems and the tanks up to the tank outlets to the engines, when 
 the airplane is in the level attitude. The propeller feathering oil in aircraft incorporating Hamilton 
 Standard propellers is not considered usable oil and is included in the ""System Oil."" The nacelle 
 oil tank capacities shown in this specification include only the usable oil for which the tanks are 
 to be placarded. All hydraulic system fluid must also be included in the empty weight of the airplane 
 (See Item 601). 
 (c) The ""unusable fuel"" is that amount of fuel in the tanks which is unavailable to the engines under critical 
 flight conditions as defined in CAR 4b.416 and may be obtained by taking the difference between the 
 ""total"" and ""usable"" tank capacities shown on Sheet 1 of this specification. The ""unusable fuel"" must 
 either be included in the airplane empty weight or be suitably accounted for in the airplane weight and 
 balance report. 
 (d) Fuel must be loaded in the front tanks first and used in the reverse order except for take-off, climb and 
 landings, at which time the front tanks must be used. 
 (e) For the interior arrangement of a particular airplane, see approved Douglas Report SM-13780, ""Loading 
 Chart and Actual Weight and Balance."" This report shows the location of all passenger and crew member 
 seats, location and capacity of all cargo and baggage compartments, buffets and storage spaces, and location 
 and capacity of lounges and lavatories for each of the different airplane arrangements covered by the above 
 mentioned report. Lounges, lavatories, and baggage or cargo compartments must be placarded for the 
 capacities specified in the approved report. The airplane must always be loaded within the C.G. limits 
 specified in this specification, accounting for crew and passenger movement and use of fuel and oil. 
 (f) Fuel must be loaded in the following order: (1) Front center wing tanks (2) Rear center wing tanks and (3) 
 Outer wing tanks. Fuel must be used in the reverse order except for take-off, climb and landings, at which 
 time the front center wing tanks must be used."
NOTE 2,"The following placards shall be placed in the locations noted: 
 (a) On the instrument panel in full view of the pilot: 
 (1) ""This airplane shall be operated in compliance with the operating limitations specified in the CAA 
 Approved Airplane Operating Manual."" 
 (2) ""Avoid continuous engine operation below 1800 rpm."" 
 (b) On inboard side of forward external baggage door, forward of and adjacent to handles: 
 ""Door handles must be accessible in flight."""
