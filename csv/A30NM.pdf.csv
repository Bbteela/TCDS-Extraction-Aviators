Certificate Basis,The certificate basis is FAR 21.25 (a) (2)
Production Basis,"None - Prior to original certification of each aircraft, an FAA representative must 
 perform an inspection for workmanship, materials, and conformity with the 
 approved technical data. All applicable Technical Orders affecting airworthiness must be 
 accomplished."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable Airworthiness Regulations 
 (see Certification Basis), must be installed in the aircraft for certification."
NOTE 1,"This approval applies to 
 A. 
 Basic United States Air Force C-130A airplane with no major modification except 
 as required by Drawing List HPA-130-DL-102 dated April 21, 1989, or later FAA 
 approved revision. 
 B. 
 Airplane certified for the special purpose of agriculture, forest/wildlife conservation, 
 aerial spraying and carrying cargo with the following limitations: 
 1. 
 The following placard is to be installed in clear view of the pilot: 
 “RESTRICTED CATEGORY” 
 “This airplane must be operated as a restricted category airplane and in 
 compliance with the operating limitations stated in USAF T.O. 1C-130A-1, 
 Section V, and in the form of placards, markings, and manuals. 
 2. 
 Carriage of hazardous materials is prohibited unless compliance is shown with 
 FAR 21.25, FAR 91, and the applicable regulations in the Code of Federal 
 Regulations 49, Part 175."
NOTE 2,"A. 
 A current weight and balance report including a list of the equipment included in 
 the certificated empty weight, and loading instructions when necessary, must be in 
 each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter. 
 B. 
 The location of the center of gravity for any gross weight configuration, as 
 determined from T.O. 1-1B-40, Handbook of Weight and Balance Data, must fall 
 within the percent of the mean aerodynamic chord (MAC) shown on the Center of 
 Gravity Limitations Chart (Figure 5-6). For information and method of calculating 
 the airplane center of gravity, refer to T.O. 1C-130A-9, Cargo Loading Handbook 
 and T.O. 1-1B-40, Handbook of Weight and Balance Data. 
 C. 
 The weight of the system fuel and oil as defined below and hydraulic fluid must be 
 included in the airplane empty weight. 
 System Fuel: The weight of all fuel required to fill all lines and tanks up to the zero 
 fuel point on the fuel gages in the level flight attitude.

 the usable oil from the total capacity. 
 Total: 221 lbs., Arm 442.0 
 D. 
 Fuel Loading and Usage 
 1. 
 Fuel must be loaded and used to provide compliance with the “Fuel 
 Unbalance” limitation contained in USAF T.O. 1C-130A-1. Refer to USAF 
 T.O. 1C-130A-1 for normal fuel management procedures. 
 2. 
 Phillips fuel additive PFA-55MB may be used in concentrations not to exceed 
 0.15 percent by volume. No fuel system anti-icing credit is allowed."
NOTE 3,"Latest revisions of the following documents are required: 
 A. 
 USAF T.O. 1C-130A-1, “Flight Manual”, Change 3, dated October 21. 1982, or

 aircraft for all flight operations. 
 B. 
 USAF T.O. 1C-130A-9, “Cargo Loading Handbook”, and Supplement No. 1, dated 
 April 28, 1967, must be used to load and restrain cargo. 
 C. 
 USAF T.O. 1-1B-40, “Handbook of Weight and Balance Data”."
