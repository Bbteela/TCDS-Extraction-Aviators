Engine Limits,"* A transient high-temperature condition is one of brief duration in which the 
 peaks and falls off, either automatically or through the corrective action of the pilot. 
 The torque may exceed 103% Q on one engine to a maximum of 123% provided that the 
 power of the other is reduced so that total torque for both engines is not over 206% Q for 
 30 minutes or 172% continuously, and that the single-engine Ng, T5, and Q limits are not 
 exceeded. The governing parameter is the limit that occurs first. 
 Any time Ng exceeds 106%, the event and its duration must be recorded. 
 Maximum oil consumption rated during operation is 12 ounces per hour.
