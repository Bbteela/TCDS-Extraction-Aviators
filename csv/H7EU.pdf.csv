 For IFR operations See NOTE 6. 
 The Italian ENAC originally type certificated this under its type certificate number 
 (A156). The FAA validated this product under U.S. Type Certificate Number (H7EU). 
 Effective September 28, 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began 
 oversight of this product on behalf of the Italian ENAC. 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR 
 Section 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR Sections 21.183(c) 
 or 21.185(c). 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR 
 Section 21.29 exported from countries other than the country of manufacture (e.g. 
 third party country) is FAR Sections 21.183(d) or 21.183(b)."
Import Requirements,"To be considered eligible for operation in the United States, each aircraft manufactured 
 under this type certificate must be accompanied by a certificate of airworthiness for 
 export or certifying statement endorsed by the exporting foreign civil airworthiness 
 authority which states (in the English language): 
 The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on a NAA Export Certificate of 
 Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the Italian ENAC or EASA 
 on behalf of the European Community. 
 The Export C of A should contain the following statement: 
 “The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to comply 
 with the EASA Type Certificate Number R.005 (formerly Italian ENAC TC Number 
 A156) approved under the U.S. Type Certificate Number H7EU and to be in a condition 
 for safe operation.” 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness 
 (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification 
 of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported 
 aircraft."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the rotorcraft for certification.
