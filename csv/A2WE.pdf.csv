 CG Range 
 The landing gear retraction moment is -380 in.-lb. and results in a negligible forward 
 movement of the C.G. When the airplane is loaded within the above C.G. envelope 
 limits as applicable at both the start of takeoff and zero fuel weights, and the restrictions 
 concerning crew and passenger movement specified in the FAA Approved Load and 
 Balance Schedule are complied with, the airplane will remain within the approved C.G. 
 limits.

 4b.362(h) to permit a main aisle width of not less than 15 inches between the two 
 aftermost seats on the aisle, measured 25 inches or more from the floor. 
 FAA Exemption No. 709: Issued August 15, 1967, grants an exemption from CAR 
 4b.362(h) to the extent necessary to permit type certification of the Model NA-265-60 
 airplane with a main aisle width of 15 inches, in the aisle space of 25 inches and more 
 from the floor, for a maximum passenger seating capacity of 10.
