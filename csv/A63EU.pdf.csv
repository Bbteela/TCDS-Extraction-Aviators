 Section 611 (b) of the FAA Act of 1958 
 The German civil airworthiness authority, the Luftfahrt Bundesamt (LBA), originally 
 type certificated this aircraft under its Type Certificate No. 2066. The FAA validated this 
 product under U.S. Type Certificate No. A63EU. Effective September 28, 2003, the 
 European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this product on 
 behalf of Germany. At this time, EASA has maintained the LBA Type Certificate Data 
 Sheet No. 2066."
Data Pertinent to all Models,
Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. Standard Airworthiness Certificate based on an Export 
 Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the LBA, on 
 behalf of the European Community. The Export C of A should contain the following 
 statement: ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found 
 to comply with U.S. airworthiness regulations 14 CFR Part 23 approved under U.S. Type 
 Certificate No. A63EU and to be in a condition for safe operation.’ 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness 
 (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification 
 of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported 
 aircraft."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulation 
 (see ""Certification Basis"") must be installed in the airplane for certification."
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by EASA or – for 
 approvals made before September 28, 2003 – by the LBA. 
  
 Service bulletins 
  
 Structural repair manuals 
  
 Vendor manuals 
  
 Aircraft flight manuals 
  
 Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved unless one of the 
 following conditions exists: 
  
 The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures of the FAA 
 approved manuals; or 
  
 The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this product’s U.S. 
 type certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. The FAA 
 may delegate case-by-case approval to EASA on behalf of the FAA for the U.S. type 
 certificate. If this is the case it will be noted on the document."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance data together with a list of equipment included in the certificated empty weight, 
 and loading instructions, when necessary, must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original 
 certification. The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of gravity locations must include the 
 following: 
 G 520 
 a) 
 unusable fuel of 47 lbs (242 in (6147 mm) aft of datum) 
 b) 
 engine oil of 17 lbs (139 in (3531 mm) aft of datum) 
 G 520T a) 
 unusable fuel of 47 lbs (242 in (6147 mm) aft of datum) 
 b) 
 engine oil of 16.75 lbs (87.6 in (2225 mm) aft of datum)"
NOTE 2,"All placards listed in Section 2, of the approved Pilot's Operating Handbook G 520 and G 520T must be 
 installed in the appropriate locations. Each airplane must be supplied with a placard that specifies the kind of 
 operations to which the operation of the airplane is limited by its installed equipment. 
 The following placard must be displayed on the instrument panel in full view of the pilot: 
 ""THE MARKINGS AND PLACARDS INSTALLED IN THIS AIRPLANE CONTAIN OPERATING 
 LIMITATIONS WHICH MUST BE COMPLIED WITH WHEN OPERATING THIS AIRPLANE IN THE 
 NORMAL CATEGORY. OTHER OPERATING LIMITATIONS WHICH MUST BE COMPLIED WITH 
 WHEN OPERATING THIS AIRPLANE IN THIS CATEGORY ARE CONTAINED IN THE AIRPLANE 
 FLIGHT MANUAL""."
NOTE 3,"G 520 
 Airworthiness Limitations. 
 Chapter 04 of the G 520 EGRETT Maintenance Manual includes the Airworthiness Limitation 
 Section 4-00-00. This section is FAA approved and specifies maintenance required under 
 paragraphs 43.16 and 91.403 of the Federal Aviation Regulations unless an alternative program has 
 been FAA approved.

 the ""Significant Structure Items Inspection"" and prior to 15,000 flight hours the ""Airframe Major Inspection"" 
 must be performed. This may provide the necessary clearance for further flight."
NOTE 5,"Major structural repairs must be accomplished by a properly certificated mechanic in accordance with data 
 approved by the FAA."
