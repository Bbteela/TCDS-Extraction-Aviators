 fire itself and from the residual heat after the airplane has been depressurized (see FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 25-9a). The 
 following design details must be maintained to ensure that at an unsafe design feature is not present: Critical systems located in 
 the main deck Class E cargo compartment must be protected from cargo fires occurring therein and the associated effects. Critical 
 systems include, but are not limited to, flight controls, critical wiring, and windows (if loss of a window could contribute to loss 
 of suppression capability). The flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder should also be protected for subsequent 
 investigative purposes if they are installed in the affected cargo compartment. If protective covers are used, they must be

 there is any feature or characteristic that would make the product unsafe. At this time, the FAA identified the following subject for further 
 review and evaluation 
 a InFlight Engine Restart 
 A minimum restart capability after an all engines out scenario must be established under the following conditions using procedures 
 provided in the airplane flight manual (AFM): 
 a) During the take-off and the initial climb-out portion of the flight, the airplane should have the capability for the flightcrew to 
 restore engine power when the fuel source to the engine is interrupted. 
 b) During the high altitude portion of the flight at cruise speed and maximum altitude, the airplane should have the capability for 
 the flightcrew to restart from a stabilized windmill speed those engines required to maintain level flight or should have the 
 capability for the flightcrew to restart all but one of the engines and produce maximum continuous thrust or power by an altitude 
 of 15,000 feet. 
 c) During flight at speeds greater than the minimum flaps-up ""holding speed"" and at altitudes below 20,000 feet, the airplane should 
 have the capability for the flightcrew to restart with the engines at stabilized windmill speed those engines necessary to maintain 
 safe flight and arrest the airplane descent within a total altitude loss of 5,000 feet prior to exceeding an airspeed of 300 knots.

 there is any feature or characteristic that would make the product unsafe. At this time, the FAA identified the following subject for further 
 review and evaluation 
 a InFlight Engine Restart 
 A minimum restart capability after an all engines out scenario must be established under the following conditions using procedures 
 provided in the airplane flight manual (AFM): 
 a) During the take-off and the initial climb-out portion of the flight, the airplane should have the capability for the flightcrew to 
 restore engine power when the fuel source to the engine is interrupted. 
 b) During the high altitude portion of the flight at cruise speed and maximum altitude, the airplane should have the capability for 
 the flightcrew to restart from a stabilized windmill speed those engines required to maintain level flight or should have the 
 capability for the flightcrew to restart all but one of the engines and produce maximum continuous thrust or power by an altitude 
 of 15,000 feet. 
 c) During flight at speeds greater than the minimum flaps-up ""holding speed"" and at altitudes below 20,000 feet, the airplane should 
 have the capability for the flightcrew to restart with the engines at stabilized windmill speed those engines necessary to maintain 
 safe flight and arrest the airplane descent within a total altitude loss of 5,000 feet prior to exceeding an airspeed of 300 knots.

 Manufacturer’s Serial NumbersProduction Basis 
 From July 21, 2008, A330 aircraft, all series and models, are produced in France under production approval reference EASA.21G.0001 
 issued by EASA on July 21, 2008, prior that date all A330 aircraft, all series and models, are produced in France under production 
 approval FR.21G.0035 (formerly FG 035) issued by the DGAC (on behalf of EASA) to Airbus. 
 Import Requirements 
 The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on either an EASA Export Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed 
 by a representative of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), or a French ""Certificat de Navigabilite pour Exportation"" 
 signed by a representative of the Direction Generale de 'Aviation Civile (DGAC) of France on behalf of the European Community. 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any required 
 statements on the export certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to 
 conformity statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, provisions for Import 
 Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate. 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 14CFR 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture 
 is §§ 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under § 21.29 exported from countries 
 other than the country manufacture (e.g., third party country) is §§ 21.183(d) or 21.185(b). These sections provide that U.S. airworthiness 
 certificates are issued only if the Administrator finds “that the aircraft conforms to the type design and is in a condition for safe operation.” 
 Notwithstanding that §§ 21.183(d) and 21.185(b) do not specifically address or require certification by the foreign civil airworthiness 
 authority of the country of manufacture, such certification is the only practical way for an applicant to show, and the FAA to find 
 conformity to the FAA-approved type design and condition for safe operation. 
 FAA Required Modification List for Airbus Model A330 Aircraft 
 Prior to issuance of a Standard Airworthiness Certificate on Airbus A330-200 or A330-300 model aircraft, all modifications shown on 
 the (Model A330) Required Modification List (RML) with compliance times already past, must be accomplished before the aircraft can 
 be found to be in a condition for safe operation. 
 RML modifications with compliance times already past means that relative to the date of issuance of an Airworthiness Certificate for an 
 individual aircraft, the compliance time of the RML item in calendar time and/or flight hours and/or flight cycles has been exceeded. 
 All future required modifications shown on the RML must be incorporated into the operator’s maintenance or inspection program prior 
 to placement of the aircraft into operation [just as for future airworthiness limitations listed in the Airworthiness Limitation Section 
 (ALS)]. These future RML modifications must be incorporated prior to the compliance time specified in the RML and must remain with 
 with and incorporated into the new operator’s maintenance program. 
 Future RML modifications means that relative to the date of issuance of an Airworthiness Certificate for an individual aircraft, the 
 compliance time of the RML item in calendar time and/or flight hours and/or flight cycles has not yet been exceeded. 
 The RML was finalized through its publication in TCDS Revision 4 and requirements will not be added by later TCDS revisions. 
 Therefore, the RML in TCDS A46NM Revision 4 or any later TCDS revision are equivalent and acceptable for compliance. All future 
 modifications that the FAA determines must be accomplished on U.S. registered aircraft will be addressed by issuance of an 
 Airworthiness Directive AD 
 Authority for these required modifications is given per the airworthiness certification provisions of 49 U.S.C. 44704 (c), which states 
 ""the Administrator may include in an airworthiness certificate terms required in the interest of safety"". “Terms required in the interest 
 of safety” include actions to correct unsafe conditions issued by the foreign authority of the state of design that also meet FAA criteria 
 for corrective action. This law also gives the FAA the authority to adopt § 21.183(c) and (d), which form the regulatory basis for the 
 issue of standard U.S. airworthiness certificates on imported products. The modifications identified in the list below are required in the 
 interest of safety and are necessary for this airplane to be in a condition for safe operation. 
 when no aircraft of the affected design are currently operating in the U.S. was published in the Federal Register on May 11, 1998, docket 
 Engines, Propellers, and Related Products Imported into the United States. 
 Alternative Methods of Compliance to an RML modification: 
 For each RML modification, an alternative method of compliance (AMOC) or adjustment of the compliance time may be used if 
 approved by the Manager, Large Aircraft Section, International Validations Branch, Compliance & Airworthiness Division, Aircraft 
 Certification Service, 2200 South 216th Street Des Moines, Washington 98198, telephone (206)-231-3219. Operators shall submit their 
 request through an appropriate FAA Principle Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Large 
 Aircraft Section International Validations Branch
