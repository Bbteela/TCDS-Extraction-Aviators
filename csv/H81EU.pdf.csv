Serial Numbers Eligible,"50007, 50009"
Import Requirements,"To be considered eligible for operation in the United States, each aircraft 
 manufactured under this Type Certificate must be accompanied by a certificate 
 of airworthiness for export or certifying statement endorsed by the exporting civil 
 airworthiness authority which states (in the English language): ""This aircraft conforms 
 to its U.S. type design (Type Certificate Number H81EU) and is in a condition for safe 
 operation. The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 
 FAR Section 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR Sections 
 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 
 FAR Section 21.29 exported from countries other than the country of manufacture 
 (e.g. third party country) is FAR Sections 21.183(d) or 21.183(b). 
 Certificates of Airworthiness under this Type Certificate may not be granted unless 
 approved passenger seating featuring upper torso restraint is installed. 
 Note: The Maintenance Manual for the EH101-300 has not been accepted by the 
 FAA, therefore this aircraft is not eligible for issuance of a standard certificate of 
 airworthiness. For further information contact AEU-100 FAA/EMB, PSC 82 Box 002, 
 APO AE 09724 or FTW-AEG, DOT/FAA, Fort Worth, TX 76193-0270."
Certification Basis,"ENAC Italy originally type certificated this rotorcraft under its type certificate A 326. 
 The FAA validated this product under U.S. type certificate Number H81EU. Effective 
 September 28, 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of 
 this product on behalf of ENAC. 
 FAR 21 including Amendment 21-61. 
 FAR 29 including Amendment 29-1 through 29-27. 
 FAR 29.351 Amendment 29-30. 
 Equivalent Safety Findings for FAR 29.903(b) and FAR 29.1303(g)(2) 
 Special condition no. 29-ASW-12 on HIRF."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (see certification basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. 
 In addition a RAI approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual is required. 
 Aviation Authority (NAA) Export Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) 
 signed by a representative of the RAI on behalf of the European Community. 
 The Export C of A should contain the following statement: “ The aircraft 
 covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to comply with 
 the type design approved under U.S. Type Certificate Number H81EU and to be 
 in a condition for safe operation,”"
Note 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated 
 empty weight, and loading instructions when necessary must be provided for each 
 aircraft at the time of original certification. 
 The certificated empty weight and corresponding CG location must include total 
 oil capacity of 22.43 U.S. Gal. (84.9 lt) at sta. 9074 mm (357.24 in) and unusable 
 fuel of 21.03 U.S. Gal. (79.6 lt) at sta. 7259 mm (285.8 in)."
Note 2,"Placards listed in the RAI approved Helicopter Flight Manual must be displayed in the 
 appropriate location."
Note 3,"Instructions for continued airworthiness of the rotorcraft are provided in the 
 following documentation: 
 - Document No. ED02P211JTC Continued Airworthiness 
 Schedule and Airworthiness Limitations Manual. 
 - Document No. EC02P002J Maintenance Manual. 
 which must be supplied with each rotorcraft at time of delivery. 
 Service bulletins, structural repair manuals, overhaul and maintenance manuals 
 which contain a statement that the document is RAI approved, are accepted by 
 the FAA and are considered FAA approved. These acceptances pertain to the type 
 design only."
