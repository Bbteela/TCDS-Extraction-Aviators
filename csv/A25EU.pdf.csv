Serial Numbers Eligible,"A Registro Aeronautico Italiano (RAI) Export Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of 
 A) as noted below under ""Import Requirements"" must be submitted for each individual 
 aircraft for which an application for airworthiness certification is made."
Certification Basis,"FAR 23 effective 1 February 1965 including Amendments 23-1 through 23-6 inclusive, 
 plus Sections 23.909, 23.1043, 23.1143, 23.1305, 23.1527, 23.1563(b), and 23.1583(k) of

 Application extended per FAR 21.17(c)(2) by FAA letter dated 20 July 1971. 
 Type Certificate No. A25EU issued 31 August 1972."
Validation Basis,"Type Certificate A25EU was issued pursuant to FAR 21.29(a)(1)(ii) in validation of the 
 Registro Aeronautico's (RAI) certification of compliance with the aforementioned type 
 certification basis."
Import Requirements,"To be considered eligible for operation in the United States each aircraft manufactured 
 under this type certificate must be accompanied by an Export C of A or certifying statement 
 endorsed by the exporting foreign civil airworthiness authority which states (in the English 
 language): “This aircraft conforms to its U.S. type design (type certificate number A25EU) 
 and is in a condition for safe operation.” 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 
 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR Sections 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 
 21.29 exported from countries other than the country of manufacture (e.g., third party 
 country) is FAR Sections 21.183(d) or 21.183(b). 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into 
 the United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the 
 agreement, to identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the 
 export certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures 
 for coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer 
 to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements 
 for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft."
Service Information,"Service bulletin, structural repair manuals, aircraft flight mauals, and overhaul and 
 maintenance manuals, which contain a statement that the document is Registro 
 Aeronautico Italiano (RAI) approved, are accepted by the FAA and are considered FAA 
 approved. These approvals pertain to the type design only."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations (see 
 Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. In addition, the 
 following items of equipment are required: 
 a) 
 Pre-stall warning indicator, Safe Flight Instrument Corp., Type 164F or 
 equivalent. 
 b) 
 Turbine inlet (engine exhaust gas) temperature indicator, P/N IU087-104-1 
 c) 
 ""R.A.I.-Approved, Airplane Model S.210 Flight Manual"", RAI-approved No. 
 101.637/T, dated 31 May 1972 and later RAI-approved revisions."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and 
 loading instructions when necessary, must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original certification, and 
 at all times thereafter. 
 The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of gravity locations must include: 
 - Unusable fuel (31.8 lb. at +100, plus 3 lb. at +101.57) 
 - Unusable oil (1.61 lb. at +61.02)"
NOTE 2,"a)
