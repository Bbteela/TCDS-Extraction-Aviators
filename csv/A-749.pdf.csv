 NOTE 1. Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated weight empty, and loading 
 instructions when necessary, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter. 
 When weight and balance computations indicate that the forward C.G. limit is exceeded, lead ballast of sufficient 
 weight to meet this limit shall be installed t (+195). Ryan Drawing No. M-1114 shows an acceptable method of 
 installing two individual three (3) lb. weights. Each weight may be lengthened and increased to a maximum of 
 10 lbs. provided the weight is adequately attached by 3/16 inch bolts to the bulkhead web and to the fuselage skin. 
 When total ballast in excess of 16 lbs. is installed, the rear C.G. limit must be restricted to (+37) (17.35% MAC).
