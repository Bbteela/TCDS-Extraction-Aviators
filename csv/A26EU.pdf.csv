NOTE 4,"Aircraft manufactured in France prior to December 11, 2006 and subsequently placed on the U.S. Registry, 
 may be granted a U.S. Airworthiness Certificate on the basis of 14 CFR Part 21, Section 21.183(d). This 
 will be a recurrent airworthiness certification and requires a statement or attestation of conformity to the 
 applicable type design at the time of original manufacture be obtained from the DGAC France (e.g., the 
 French TC / U.S. 21.29). This “baseline” conformity determination can then be used as a starting point for 
 which to evaluate the aircraft’s present conformity of type design and condition for safe operation as 
 required by 21.183(d) (e.g., Review of all modifications and repairs, AD compliance, appropriate 
 maintenance, etc., depending upon the current exporting authority and any applicable bilateral agreement)."
