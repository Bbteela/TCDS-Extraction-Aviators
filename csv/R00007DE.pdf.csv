Certification Basis,"FAR 21.25(a)(2), effective February 1, 1965, including Amendments 21-1 through 21-74. 
 Type Certificate No. R00007DE, for the special purposes of: 
 I) Agricultural Operations under FAR 21.25(b)(1). 
 Note: In accordance with FAR 36.1 (a)(4), compliance with the noise requirements was 
 not shown. Therefore aircraft certified under this type certificate are only eligible for 
 agricultural operations excepted by FAR 36.1 (a)(4) and defined under FAR 137.3. 
 2) Forest and Wildlife Conservation Operations under FAR 2l.25(b)(2). 
 Note: In accordance with FAR 36.1 (a)(4), compliance with the noise requirements was 
 not shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this type certificate are only eligible for 
 dispensing fire fighting material excepted by FAR 36.l(a)(4) and defined under FAR 
 137.3. 
 3) External Load Operations under FAR 21.25(b)(7). 
 Note: In accordance with FAR 36.1 (a)(4), compliance with the noise requirements was 
 not shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this type certificate are only eligible for 
 external load operations excepted by FAR 36.1(a)(4) and defined under FAR133.1(b). 
 Any alteration to the aircraft for Special Purposes not identified above require further 
 FAA approval and in addition, may require noise and / or flight testing. 
 General Note: Any subsequent modifications to the helicopters type certified under this 
 Type Certificate are to have the certification basis for that modification established under 
 14 CFR 21.101 published June 7, 2000 which became effective June 10, 2003. 
 Otherwise non-significant modifications are to meet the requirements of 14 CFR 29 
 airworthiness standards, transport category, Amendment 1, effective August 12, 1965, 
 plus special conditions for turbine engine installations and 14 CFR 29.1529, Instructions 
 for Continued Airworthiness, Amendment 20, effective September 11, 1980. Also 
 should consider that military installed crashworthy fuel systems in some of these aircraft 
 and should require that to be maintained."
Production Basis,"None. No helicopter may be produced under this approval. Prior to adding serial 
 numbers to this Type Certificate, each candidate helicopter must undergo a conformity 
 inspection. The conformity inspection will be conducted in accordance with a Type 
 Inspection Authorization, Part 1, or request for conformity that will include as a 
 minimum, the inspections contained in the FAA Rotorcraft Directorate Restricted 
 Category conformity document dated September 25, 2001 or later FAA approved 
 revisions."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be in each helicopter for certification. The following 
 equipment and documents must be available in each helicopter for certification: 
 (1) U.S. Army TM55-1520-210-10, Operators Manual, UH-1H. 
 (2) Standard U.S. Army cargo suspension system installation, 204-070-900-5, 204-070- 
 900-19 IAW TM55-1520-210-23P (Part Manual), installed and maintained IAW TM55- 
 1520-210-23 (Maintenance Manual), and operated IAW TM55-1520-210-10 (Operators 
 Manual) for all external cargo operations."
NOTE 1,"A current weight and balance report including a list of equipment included in the 
 certificated empty weight, and loading instructions, when necessary must be provided for 
 each aircraft at the time of the original certification. Refer to Operators Manual, TM55- 
 1520-210-10, Chapter 6 and Maintenance Manual, TM55-1520-210-23 Para. 1-38, for 
 leveling means and weight and balance determination."
