Serial Numbers eligible,"The original Navy designation for the following airplanes was the S2F-1 and this 
 designation will appear on the nameplate. Post- delivery modifications were made 
 resulting in S2F-1T for training use. In 1962, a new numbering system was established 
 for all military airplanes and the S2F-1 became the S2A. Consequently, the trainer S2F- 
 1T version was called the TS-2A. Only those airplanes listed below are eligible for 
 Airworthiness Certification.
