 FAA-Approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual. 
 Fuel and Oil capacities as indicated are total tank capacities over and above ""Trapped Fuel and 
 Oil."" The main fuel tank capacity includes ""Unusable"" fuel of 0.3 gallon, which cannot be used 
 safely in all flight attitudes, and which must be included in the empty weight. Unusable fuel in the 
 optional auxiliary fuel tanks is negligible."

 or service life cannot be increased without FAA Engineering approval. 
 Life limited components interchanged between UH-12 series models or configurations must be 
 restricted to the lowest service life indicated for the models or configurations that the individual 
 part has been used on. If previous service history does not identify the model or configuration, 
 the lowest service life of all possible models or configurations must be used. Life limited 
 components removed at retirement are to be destroyed or conspicuously marked to prevent 
 inadvertent return to service.
