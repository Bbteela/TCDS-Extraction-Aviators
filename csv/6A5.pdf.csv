 NOTE 1. (a) Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated weight empty, and loading 
 instructions, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter (except in the 
 case of air carrier operators having an approved weight control system). See approved Master Equipment List 
 (LAC Report 8097) for list of approved items of equipment in addition to those items listed in this specification. 
 (b) The airplane must be loaded so that the C.G. is within the specified limits at all times, with the effects of fuel 
 use, gear retraction, and movement of crew and passengers from their assigned positions being considered 
 (retraction of the main and nose gears causes the C.G. to move forward, a value of 186,000 in. lbs. is a 
 satisfactory approximation of the change in moment for all approved wheel items). At takeoff, the airplane shall 
 be loaded so that, due to fuel use, the C.G. cannot move forward of 18% MAC. A 34% aft C.G. limit (gear 
 retracted) for cruising flight may be used when the effect of passenger and crew movements from their assigned 
 positions has been taken into account. 
 (c) ""Unusable Fuel and System Oil"" and all hydraulic fluid must be included in the certificated weight empty. (See 
 Item 101) 
 Unusable fuel is that quantity of fuel in the system and in the tanks which is unavailable to the engines under 
 critical flight conditions as defined in CAR 4b.494. Thus unusable fuel, includes ""system fuel"" which is defined 
 as the quantity required to fill the system and tanks to the tank outlet level when the airplane is in the ground 
 level attitude. The fuel gages are calibrated with the unusable fuel level as the zero datum. The total amount of 
 fuel (Unusable included in Item 101) is as follows:

 System oil is that amount of oil required to fill the oil systems and tanks to the tank outlets to the engines. 
 The propeller feathering oil is not considered usable oil, and, when applicable, is included in ""System oil."" 
 The oil tank capacities shown in this specification include only the usable oil for which the tanks are placarded. 
 Dipstick readings indicate the amount of usable oil.

The indicated combinations of undumpable fuel and the corresponding standpipe arrangement apply to any model within a,
given block,"(Same as amount prior to dumping (no dump valves in this tank). 
 Standpipe height increased to accommodate EA-3 engines. 
 Operational zero fuel weight must not exceed the design landing weight minus the total undumpable fuel weight (including fuel 
 in tank No. 5 at take-off), but in any case must not exceed design zero fuel weight. (The above undumpable fuel quantities at 6 
 lbs. per gallon should be used in this determination)."
e Fuel loading and usage,"(1) Fuel must be distributed and used in a manner that will permit compliance with the lateral balance 
 limitations in the FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual.
