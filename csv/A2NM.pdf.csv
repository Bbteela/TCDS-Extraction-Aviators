 positions."
Note 2,"The aircraft must be operated in accordance with the FAA-Approved Airplane Flight Manual. All 
 placards required in either the FAA-Approved Airplane Flight Manual, the applicable operating 
 rules or the Certification Basis must be installed in the airplane.

 Requirements (CMR). All Boeing model 757 airplanes must fully comply with the appropriate 
 revision of this section. However, regarding the 
 damage tolerance structural inspections contained in Subsection (B) of this section, all Boeing 
 Model 757-200 airplanes production line number 765 and on, must comply with Revision May 
 1997, or a later FAA approved revisions. Applicable to all 757-200 airplanes with production 
 numbers lower than 765, the FAA issued Airworthiness Directive AD 2001-20-12, mandating 
 compliance with Revision May 1997 or Revision November 1998 of Section 9. For all 757-200

 compliance with certain inspections that are now contained within Section 9 as CMRs. For 
 airplanes affected by these ADs, each subsequent revision to Section 9 must be approved as an 
 alternative method of compliance (AMOC). All 757-300 airplanes equipped with Rolls-Royce 
 RB211-535E4 series engines must comply with Revision November 1998 (or later FAA-approved
