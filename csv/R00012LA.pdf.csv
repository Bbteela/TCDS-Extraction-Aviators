 shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this type certificate are only eligible for 
 external loads operations excepted by § 36.1(a)(4) and defined under § 133.1(b). 
 Any alteration to the aircraft for Special Purposes not identified above require further 
 FAA approval and in addition, may require noise and/or flight testing. 
 General Note: Any subsequent modifications to the helicopters type certified under this 
 Type Certificate are to have the certification basis for that modification established under
