 The Federal Republic of Germany Government Certificate of Airworthiness for Export 
 endorsed as noted below under ""Import Requirements"" must be submitted for each 
 individual aircraft for which application for airworthiness certification is made."
Certification basis,"FAR 21.29 and FAR 23 dated 1 February 1965 as amended by Amendments 23-1 
 through 23-9 inclusive. Type Certificate No. A27EU, issued 9 July 1971. 
 Date of Application for Type Certificate: 11 May 1970. 
 The Luftfahrt Bundesamt originally type certificated this aircraft under its type certificate 
 Number 680. The FAA validated this product under U.S. Type Certificate Number 
 A27EU. Effective September 28, 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) 
 began oversight of this product on behalf of Germany. 
 The EASA type certificate for the BO-209 models is EASA.A.357."
Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export Certificate 
 of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the Luftfahrt Bundesamt 
 on behalf of the European Community. The Export C of A should contain the following 
 statement: ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found 
 to comply with U.S. airworthiness regulations 14 CFR Part 23 approved under U.S. 
 Type Certificate No. A27EU and to be in a condition for safe operation.’"
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the European 
 Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before September 28, 2003 – 
 by the Luftfahrt Bundesamt. 
 • Service bulletins, 
 • Structural repair manuals, 
 • Vendor manuals, 
 • Aircraft flight manuals, and 
 • Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved unless one of the 
 following conditions exists: 
 • The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures of the FAA 
 approved manuals; or 
 •The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this product’s U.S. type 
 certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. The 
 FAA may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to approve on behalf of the FAA for the 
 U.S. type certificate. If this is the case it will be noted on the document."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. In addition, 
 the following items of equipment are required: 
 1. 
 Stall Warning System. 
 2. 
 LBA-approved Model BO-209 Approved Flight Manual, Ref. No. 
 LF37E-7/71 dated July 1971 or later LBA-approved revision, (prior to September 
 28, 2003), or approved by EASA on or after that date. 
 3. 
 Airplanes S/N 121 through 130 must be modified in accordance with MBB 
 Technical Note TN 9-71 to provide an alternate static system source 
 and an aural landing gear warning system. (These systems are incorporated 
 in production on S/Ns 131 and subsequent)."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment in certificated empty weight, and loading 
 instructions when necessary, must be provided for each airplane at the time of original airworthiness 
 certification. The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of gravity must include 
 undrainable oil of 0 lbs. at +39.4 and unusable fuel of 3.6 lb. at +90.7."
NOTE 2,"The following placard must be displayed in front and in clear view of the pilot: 
 ""This airplane must be operated as a Normal or Utility Category airplane in compliance with their 
 operating limitations stated in the form of placards, markings, and manuals."" 
 In addition, all placards required in the LBA-approved Airplane Flight Manual must be installed 
 in the appropriate location."
NOTE 3,"Information essential for proper maintenance of the airplane is contained in the Messerschmitt-Bolkow- 
 Blohm GmbH., Model BO-209 Maintenance Manual included in MBB document Ref. LF 37E-7/71."
NOTE 4,"The airplane manufacturer is: 
 Waggon- und Maschienenbau A.G. 
 Donauworth, Laupheim 
 Federal Republic of Germany 
 (A division of Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm)."
NOTE 5,"Installation of a Tost tow coupling (ring type), LBA approval No. 60.230.4 may be approved when 
 installed in accordance with MBB Drwg. 209-85003 (for glider towing) or MBB Drwgs. 209-85003 
 and 209-8700 (for banner towing)."
NOTE 6,"For issuance of an airworthiness certificate in accordance with 14 CFR Part 21.182(c), the Luftfahrt Bundesamt of 
 Germany must certify that the airplane conforms to the type design and is in a condition for safe operation. In that 
 regard, the Luftfahrt Bundesamt of Germany will certify that the airplane complies with all applicable mandatory 
 continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) it has issued. For issuance of an airworthiness certificate in 
 accordance with 14 CFR Part 21.182(d) the certificating inspector, or other authorized person, must find, among 
 other things, that the product is in a condition for safe operation. In order to make that finding, the certificating 
 inspector or other authorized person should contact ACE-112, Federal Aviation Administration, Small Airplane 
 Directorate, prior to issuance to determine whether showing airplane compliance with certain MCAI is necessary 
 to support a finding that the airplane is in a condition for safe operation."
NOTE 7,"Some of these transfers were not notified to the FAA and so in some instances the actual type certificates were 
 not reissued."
