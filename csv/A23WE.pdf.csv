NOTE 1,"(a) The weight of system unusable fuel and oil, as defined below, must be accounted for in the airplane 
 operational empty weight, and is listed in the FAA Approved Lockheed Martin Weight and Balance"
Manual,"specified for each airplane. 
 System Fuel 
 The weight of all fuel required to fill lines and tanks up to the zero fuel on the quantity gages in 
 the most critical flight attitude. This includes the unusable tank and plumbing fuel as defined by 
 FAR Part 25.959, and the usable but ungageable fuel in the tanks and plumbing. The L-1011-385-1 
 and L-1011-385-1-14 airplanes have 206 pounds (based on 6.7 pounds per gallon) of unusable 
 fuel in the tanks and plumbing (see NOTE 1.(e)) and 569 pounds of usable but ungageable fuel 
 in the plumbing (see NOTE 1.(e)). This 569 pounds of fuel must be included in the total unusable 
 fuel to obtain the correct weight and C.G. for takeoff (see FAA Approved Weight and Balance 
 Manual). The L-1011-385-1-15 airplane has 240 pounds (based on 6.7 pounds per gallon) of 
 unusable fuel in the tanks and plumbing, and 609 pounds of usable but ungageable fuel in the 
 tanks and plumbing. This 609 pounds of fuel must be included in the total usable fuel to obtain 
 the correct weight and C.G. for take-off. (See FAA Approved Weight and Balance Manual). 
 The L-1011-385-3 airplane has 238 pounds of (based on 6.7 pounds per gallon) of unusable fuel 
 in the tanks and plumbing and 774 pounds of usable but ungageable fuel in the plumbing. This 
 774 pounds of fuel must be included in the total usable fuel to obtain the correct weight and C.G. 
 for takeoff. (See FAA Approved Weight and Balance Manual.) 
 There are 570 pounds (based on 6.7 pounds per gallon) of ungageable but usable fuel in the 
 L-1011-385-1 and -1-14 tanks, 720 pounds of ungageable but usable fuel in the L-1011-385-1-15 
 tanks and 607 pounds of ungageable but usable fuel in the L-1011-385-3 tanks. This fuel is 
 included in the tank fuel listed in this data sheet. 
 System Oil 
 The weight of oil remaining in the engine, accessories, lines and tanks after subtracting the 
 oil in the tanks which is above zero gage levels. The engine oil tank capacities shown elsewhere 
 in this data sheet include only the usable oil for which the tanks must be placarded."
NOTE 1,"(b) The ""unusable"" fuel is that amount of fuel in the tanks and plumbing which is unavailable to the 
 engines under critical flight conditions as defined in FAR Part 25.959. This ""unusable"" fuel quantity 
 of 206 pounds in the L-1011-385-1 and -1-14 airplanes (see NOTE 1.(e)), 240 pounds in the 
 L-1011-385-1-15 airplanes and 238 pounds in the L-1011-385-3 airplanes is included in the System 
 Fuel as indicated in NOTE 1.(c) and need not be accounted for separately."
NOTE 1,"(c) Fuel capacities shown in this data sheet as well as fuel loading fuel and usage procedures are dictated 
 by structural design criteria, and to maintain airplane C.G. within approved limits at completion of fuel

 FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual for limitations to be observed during operation without the 
 fuel jettison system. Refer to the FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual for limitations to be 
 observed during operation without the jettison system and when dumping fuel with the jettison 
 system. Fuel jettisoning may be terminated by the Flight Crew at any time during the operation, and 
 the total quantity of fuel not jettisoned must be included in the landing weight. 
 The quantity of unjettisonable fuel remaining in the tanks at automatic cutoff is as follows for fuel 
 weight based on 6.7 pounds per gallon: 
 Tank No. 
 Fuel Quantity (lb.) 
 2L 
 3,900
