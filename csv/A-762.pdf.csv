 Fuel and Oil.” The nacelle oil tank capacities shown in this specification include only the usable 
 oil for which the tanks are to be placarded. 
 (c) For passenger and extra crew member seat locations, see approved weight and balance report for the 
 particular model airplane. Lounges and lavatories should be placarded for the capacities specified in the 
 approved loading schedule. 
 (d) The airplane must always be loaded within the C.G. limits specified, accounting for crew and 
 passenger movement and use of fuel and oil. Retraction of the landing gear changes the airplane 
 balancing moment by -193,400 inch lbs. and moves the C.G. forward."
NOTE 2,"The following placards shall be placed on the instrument panel in full view of the pilot: 
 (a) “This airplane shall be operated in accordance with the FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual.” 
 (FAA Approved Operating Manual equivalent.) (All Models) 
 (b) With item 100(a), (b), (c), (d), (f) or (g) engines: “Continuous operation of engines between 
 2310-2510 rpm prohibited.” 
 With item 1(a) propellers and 100(a), (b), (c), (d), (f), or (g) engines: 
 “Avoid continuous operation between 1550 and 1750 rpm and between 2310 and 2510 rpm. 
 During ground running, avoid operation between 1550 and 1800 rpm when the blades are off 
 the low pitch stops.” 
 (c) With item 100(e) engines: 
 “Continuous operation of engines between 2050-2200 is prohibited. 
 Maximum cruise rpm 2050.” 
 When wing spars have been reinforced in accordance with Chicago & Southern Dwg. B4-1452, 
 the “Maximum cruise rpm 2050” may be deleted from the placard. 
 (d) On all models with outer wing tanks installed except model C54-DC: 
 “Do not land with more than 395 gallons of fuel in each outboard main tank and outboard 
 auxiliary tank combined and with not more than & total of 790 gallons of fuel in the main 
 tanks and outboard auxiliary tank in either wing.” 
 (e) On model C54-DC with outer wing tanks installed: 
 “Do not land with more than 358 gallons of fuel in each outboard main tank and outboard 
 auxiliary tank combined and with not more than a total of 715 gallons of fuel in the main 
 tanks and auxiliary tank in either wing."
NOTE 3,"(a) Fuel Dumping. Fuel dump valves (Item 101) must be installed for operation of the airplane 
 at weights in excess of maximum landing weight as indicated in Table “A” of NOTE 9. 
 Limitations to be observed during the dumping of fuel and which should be contained in the CAA 
 Approved Airplane Flight Manual are covered in Subparagraphs (b), (c), and (d) below. 
 (b) Fuel shall not be dumped except when flaps and landing gear are retracted. After fuel has been 
 dumped, flight shall not be continued at a speed greater than 193 mph . True indicated on the 
 Model C54-DC and 209 mph True Indicated on all other models. 
 is not possible to dump sufficient fuel to reduce the gross weight for landing when the aircraft is 
 loaded to its maximum permissible “zero fuel weight” and only the minimum amount of fuel 
 required by the Speed and Load Factor Limitations Chart is loaded in Accordance with NOTE 10. 
 Therefore, the maximum “zero fuel weight of the aircraft must be reduced sufficiently to insure that 
 there will be enough fuel in the outboard main and outboard auxiliary tanks for dumping down to 
 the approved landing weight, accounting for the amount of fuel remaining in the tanks after 
 dumping. 
 (d) When dump valves are installed (Item 101), the amount of fuel remaining in the fuel tanks after 
 dumping is as follows: 
 Outboard Main 
 70 gallons each 
 Inboard Main 
 70 gallons each 
 Outboard Auxiliary 
 53 gallons each 
 Inboard Auxiliary (if installed) 
 91 gallons each"
NOTE 4,"Prior to certification as a civil aircraft, the requirements for certification as outlined in the following listed 
 reports for the particular model must be complied with: 
 C54-DC Douglas Report No. SM11139 
 C54A-DC Douglas Report No. SM11157 
 C54B-DC Douglas Report No. SM11158 
 C54D-DC Douglas Report No. SM11159 
 C54E-DC Douglas Report No. SM11147 
 C54G-DC Douglas Report No. SM11160 
 Because the requirements for original certification are different for each model, the original model 
 designation should be retained regardless of whether the engine is the same as originally installed or 
 whether a different engine is installed. (See “Optional Equipment” items for each model for alternate 
 engine installations.)"
NOTE 5,"Passenger seats and safety belt installations other than originally provided by the manufacturer must be 
 of an approved type or shown to meet the strength requirement of CAR 4."
NOTE 6,"Because two emergency exits are not available when three or four fuselage tanks are installed , only 22 
 passengers, including crew members, may be carried in the passenger compartment. When tanks are 
 removed, or when the two forward tanks are installed and the forward cabin bulkhead is moved forward 
 to clear the emergency exits, the capacity of the cabin may be increased to that corresponding to the 
 number of seats installed."
NOTE 7,"When fuselage oil tanks are removed, the airplane must be placarded to avoid carrying more than 2400 
 gallons of fuel when the nacelle oil tanks are filled to their total usable capacity of 80 gallons, thereby 
 insuring a fuel oil ratio of not over 30 to 1. The auxiliary fuel tanks should be placarded for the quantity 
 of gasoline not to exceed the difference between 2400 gallons and the total capacity of the main fuel 
 tanks. On aircraft which have only the four center wing integral tanks and with not more than one 
 fuselage fuel tank installed, the fuselage oil tank may be removed and the above placard will not be 
 necessary."
NOTE 8,"When Elevator Control Column Balance Weights (Item 612) are installed in accordance with the 
 Douglas or Drawings listed below, the rear C.G. may be extended to (407.6) with gear retracted 
 for enroute operation: 
 All C54-DC Series

 Dwg. 5102774-503 
 On aircraft having engines of more than 1100 maximum continuous horsepower installed the 
 Control Column Balance Weights (Item 612) must be installed."
NOTE 9,"Table “A” below lists the maximum landing and take-off weights for the various airplane and engine 
 installations covered by this specification. When dump valves are required for the higher take-off weights 
 indicated in Table “A”, standpipes must also be installed in the dump valve system in accordance with

"*The landing gear on the Model DC-4 may be extended at a maximum speed of 180 mph True Ind. On all other models, the",
NOTE 10,"All DC-4 and C54-DC Series aircraft must be operated in accordance with the approved “Speed and Load Factor 
 Limitations Chart”, shown in the pertinent approved Flight Manual referred to in Table “B” for the various models. 
 The “Speed and Load Factor Limitations Chart” indicates the maximum take-off weight and corresponding speed at 
 which the aircraft may be operated in flight depending upon the amount of fuel and oil in the wing prior to take-off. 
 The weight of the aircraft as loaded less fuel and nacelle oil shall not exceed the “Zero Fuel and Nacelle Oil Gross 
 Weights” shown on the pertinent “Speed and Load Factor Limitations Chart.” Fuel must be loaded equally in the 
 main tanks and consumed equally. If the aircraft has 6 or 8 wing tanks, the main tanks must be filled first before 
 fuel is loaded in the auxiliary tanks. In the case of the eight wing tank aircraft the outboard auxiliary tanks must be 
 filled after filling the main tanks, before any fuel is loaded in the inboard auxiliary tanks. Take-off and landing must 
 be made on the main tanks. If fuel has been loaded in the auxiliary tanks, it must be consumed after take-off prior to 
 using the fuel in the main tanks. 
 In the eight wing tank airplane, it is also possible to load fuel as follows: 
 (a) Load fuel in the inboard and outboard auxiliary fuel tanks equally or load the inboard tanks first, after the main 
 tanks have been filled, instead of loading fuel in the outboard auxiliary tanks as specified above. 
 (b) Fuel may be loaded in the inboard auxiliary tanks before the main tanks and outboard auxiliary tanks; in this 
 condition, the remaining fuel must be loaded in the main tanks first and then the outboard auxiliary tanks. If 
 either of these alternate procedures is used, the weight of all fuel loaded in the inboard auxiliary tanks must be 
 considered as fuselage weight, and only that fuel loaded in the outboard auxiliary and the main tanks may be 
 considered as fuel weight in the wing for operation of the airplane in accordance with the “Speed and Load 
 Factor Limitations Chart.” Fuel must be used from the outboard auxiliary tanks before the fuel is consumed 
 from the main tanks except for take-off and landing, in which case fuel must be used from the main tanks. 
 On aircraft incorporating two fuel dump chutes, one on eight wing and attached to the outboard main and auxiliary 
 fuel tanks, it is impossible to dump sufficient fuel to reduce the weight down to the maximum landing weight when 
 fuel is loaded in accordance with the procedures outlined above. Therefore, on aircraft incorporating two fuel dump 
 chutes and P&W 2SD13G or D-5 engines, the fuel loading procedures and “Speed and Load Factor Limitations” 
 referred to in Table “B” above should be followed. On all other aircraft incorporating two fuel dump chutes and 
 other engine installations, it will be necessary to reduce the maximum zero fuel and nacelle oil-gross weight to such 
 a point that it will be possible to reduce the weight by dumping to the maximum approved for landing when fuel is 
 loaded in accordance with paragraph 1 and 2 above."
