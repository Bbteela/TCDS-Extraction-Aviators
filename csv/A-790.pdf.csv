 Takeoff and Landing: Under the most favorable conditions 
 of smooth packed snow at temperatures approximately 30°F. 
 skiplane takeoff distance is approximately 10 percent greater 
 than the distance shown for the landplane. In applying the 
 performance data, caution should be exercised in that 
 lower temperatures or other snow conditions will increase 
 the ski friction and hence increase the takeoff run and either 
 increase or decrease the landing run. 
 Climb Performance: The skiplane rate of climb is
