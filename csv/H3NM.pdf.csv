Certification Basis,"FAR 21.25(a)(2), as amended by 21-42 dated January 6, 1975. Type Certificate H3NM 
 issued January 19, 1984, for the special purpose of: 
 (1) External Load Operations under FAR 21.25(b)(7). 
 Note: In accordance with FAR 36.1(a)(4), compliance with the noise requirements 
 was not shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this type certificate are only 
 eligible for external load operations excepted by FAR 36.1(a)(4) and defined under 
 FAR 133.1(b). 
 Any alteration to the helicopter for Special Purposes not identified above require further 
 FAA approval and in addition, may require noise and/or flight testing. 
 General Note: Any subsequent modifications to the helicopter type certified under this Type 
 Certificate are to have the certification basis for that modification established under 14 CFR 
 21.101 published June 7, 2000 which became effective June 10, 2003. Otherwise non- 
 significant modifications are to meet the requirements of CAR 7 airworthiness standards, 
 including Amendment 7-5, effective May 1962 plus special conditions for turbine engine 
 installations and 14 CFR 29.1529, Instructions for continued airworthiness, Amendment 20, 
 effective September 11, 1980. Also should consider that military installed crashworthy fuel 
 systems in some of these aircraft and should require that to be maintained."
Production Basis,"None. No helicopters may be produced under this approval. (See Note 4) Prior to adding 
 serial numbers to this Type Certificate, each candidate helicopter must undergo a conformity 
 inspection. The conformity inspection will be conducted in accordance with a Type 
 Inspection Authorization, Part 1, or request for conformity that will include as a minimum, 
 the inspections contained in the FAA Rotorcraft Directorate Restricted Category Conformity 
 document dated September 25, 2001 or later FAA approved revision."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations, (see 
 certification basis), must be installed in each type helicopter for certification. In addition, the 
 following is required: 
 1) US Army TM55-1520-219-10, Operators manual, UH-1B. 
 2) All external equipment and its attachments installed on this aircraft must be FAA 
 approved."
NOTE 1,"A current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight 
 and loading instructions must be in each helicopter at time of original airworthiness certification. 
 Refer to pages 12-4a and 12-4b of Operators Manual TM55-1520-219-10 or Apex. D of Maintenance 
 Manual TM55-1520-219-20 for CG determinations and use of ballast if required."

 temperature limit placard installed on the instrument panel must correspond to the engine data plate 
 gas producer speed. Gas producer speed limits also vary with OAT in accordance with the schedule 
 as shown on the temperature limit (GO-NO-GO TAKE OFF) placard on the instrument panel."
NOTE 12,"Maximum permissible exhaust gas temperature varies with ambient temperature as described in the
