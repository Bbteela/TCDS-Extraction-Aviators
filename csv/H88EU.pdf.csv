 The main differences between the EC135T2+/P2+ and the EC135T3/P3 are as 
 follows: 
 a. 
 Increase of the maximum Take-off Weight from 2950kg to 2980kg 
 b. 
 Increase of main rotor blade geometry and length to improve the rotor blade 
 efficiency 
 c. 
 Introduction of Lateral Engine Air Inlet to reduce the engine air intake losses 
 d. 
 Increase of engine performance through FADEC software change. 
 e. 
 MEGHAS software adaptation for the new dynamics of the helicopter and 
 adaptation of 3-Axis autopilot software resulting from these changes.

 The German Authority Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA) originally type certificated this under 
 its type certificate number (LBA 3061). The FAA validated this product under U.S. Type 
 Certificate Number (H88EU). Effective September 28, 2003, the European Aviation 
 Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this product on behalf of the German LBA 
 (EASA TC R.009)."
Import Requirements,"To be considered eligible for operation in the United States, each aircraft manufactured under 
 this type certificate must be accompanied by a certificate of airworthiness for export or 
 certifying statement endorsed by the exporting foreign civil airworthiness authority which 
 states (in the English language): “The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, 
 test, and found to comply with the German LBA TC Number 3061 (or EASA TC Number 
 R.009) approved under the U.S. Type Certificate Number H88EU and to be in a condition for 
 safe operation.” 
 The EC135 P3H or EC135 T3H is an EASA variant that corresponds to the FAA validated 
 EC135P3 or EC135T3 model equipped with HELIONIX for SN 2001 and up. FAA 
 documentation does not identify or distinguish between these variants."
Equipment,"The minimum required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the respective helicopter for certification.

NOTE 2,"The model EC-135 rotorcraft employs electronic engine controls, commonly named Full 
 Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC) and is recognized to be more susceptible to 
 Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) than rotorcraft that have only manual (non-electronic) 
 controls. (EMI may be the result of radiated or conducted interference.) For this reason 
 modifications that add or change systems that have the potential for EMI, must either be 
 qualified to a standard acceptable to the FAA or tested at the time of installation for 
 interference to the FADEC. This type of testing must employ the particular FADEC’s 
 diagnostic techniques and external diagnostic techniques. The test procedure must be FAA 
 approved."
