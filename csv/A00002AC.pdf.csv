Note 5,"The Model EA500 incorporates integrated avionics systems using software-based line 
 replaceable units (LRU’s) which share a digital signal transmission bus. The avionics 
 configuration of the Model EA500 as delivered from production is critical to the proper 
 operation of the cockpit instrumentation system. Modification to the LRU software supplied 
 with the Model EA500, replacement of an LRU with a different LRU, addition of new LRU, 
 or alteration of an LRU interface could adversely affect the airworthiness of the certified 
 product. Accordingly, no changes to the integrated avionics system may be made without 
 coordination with the Certificate Management Aircraft Certification Office."
Note 6,"The Eclipse Model EA500 fuselage incorporates a specialized joining process and structural 
 optimization that may not be compatible with traditional repair methodologies. Incorporation 
 of repairs or alterations using traditional methods could adversely affect airworthiness. 
 Accordingly, major alterations or repairs (ref. 14 CFR Part 43, Appendix A) to fuselage 
 structure that are not listed in EAI Structural Repair Manual (SRM) No. 06-117755 must be 
 coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration's Certificate Management Aircraft 
 Certification Office."
