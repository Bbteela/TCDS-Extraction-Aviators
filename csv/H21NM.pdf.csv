NOTE 20,"This Type Certificate (TC) has been designated ""ABANDONED"". A “Notice of 
 Intent To Designate as Abandoned Certain Type Certificates Issued in the Restricted 
 Category,” was published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the Federal 
 Register on August 8, 2003 (68 FR 47379). That Notice listed this TC. The FAA 
 received no comments on the published Notice. The FAA has been unable to contact this 
 TC holder. Hence, the FAA has determined that this TC holder is not complying with its 
 Continued Operational Safety (COS) responsibilities. Therefore, no additional aircraft 
 will be added to this TC and no additional original airworthiness certificates will be 
 issued based on this TC. The effectiveness of this TC is limited to those aircraft that 
 received original airworthiness certification prior to the incorporation of this note (Date 
 of Incorporation, January 24, 2005). Subsequently, if the TC holder is located and 
 assumes their COS responsibilities, the restriction(s) imposed by this note may be lifted."
