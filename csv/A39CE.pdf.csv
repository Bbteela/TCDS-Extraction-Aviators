NOTE 2,"(a) Current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, 
 and loading instructions when necessary, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification 
 and at all times thereafter. 
 (b) The location of the center of gravity for any gross weight configuration, determined from T.O. 
 1-1B-40, Handbook of Weight and Balance Data, must fall within the percent of the mean 
 aerodynamic chord (MAC) shown on the Center of Gravity Limitations Chart (figure 5-6). For 
 information and method of calculating the airplane center of gravity, refer to T.O. 1C-130A-9, 
 Cargo Loading Handbook, and T.O. 1-1B-40, Handbook of Weight and Balance Data. 
 (c) The weight of the system fuel and oil as defined below, and hydraulic fluid, must be included in the 
 airplane empty weight.
