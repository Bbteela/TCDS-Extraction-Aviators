 Type Certificate No. H12WE issued April 28, 1980 for the purpose of: 
 Carriage of external loads, per FAR 133 Date of application for Type Certificate

 The military helicopters certificated restricted category under Type Certificate No. 
 H12WE with aluminum engine mount fittings P/N 1620-61435-series are not eligible for 
 standard category S-58 configuration. Prior to standard airworthiness certification, 
 information regarding eligibility and modification to be accomplished should be obtained 
 from Sikorsky Aircraft."
Production Basis,"None. Prior to original airworthiness certification of each aircraft, FAA personnel must 
 perform an airworthiness inspection determining condition for safe operation and 
 determine the applicant has conducted a satisfactory flight test. See NOTE 4 for data on 
 Service Bulletins and ADs."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed for the special purpose operation and as 
 necessary for safe operation must be installed in each helicopter."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and 
 loading instructions, when necessary, must be in each helicopter at the time of original airworthiness 
 certification and at all times thereafter."
NOTE 2,"The following placard must be prominently displayed in the cockpit in full view of the pilot (On Instrument 
 Panel):

NOTE 6,"This Type Certificate (TC) has been designated ""ABANDONED"". A “Notice of Intent To Designate as 
 Abandoned Certain Type Certificates Issued in the Restricted Category,” was published by the Federal 
 Aviation Administration (FAA) in the Federal Register on August 8, 2003 (68 FR 47379). That Notice listed 
 this TC. The FAA received no comments on the published Notice. The FAA has been unable to contact this 
 TC holder. Hence, the FAA has determined that this TC holder is not complying with its Continued 
 Operational Safety (COS) responsibilities. Therefore, no additional aircraft will be added to this TC and no 
 additional original airworthiness certificates will be issued based on this TC. The effectiveness of this TC is 
 limited to those aircraft that received original airworthiness certification prior to the incorporation of this 
 note (Date of Incorporation, January 24, 2005). Subsequently, if the TC holder is located and assumes their 
 COS responsibilities, the restriction(s) imposed by this note may be lifted."
