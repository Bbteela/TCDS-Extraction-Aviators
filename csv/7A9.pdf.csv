Serial Nos eligible,"The United Kingdom Certificate of Airworthiness for export endorsed 
 as noted under ""Certification basis"" must be submitted for each individual 
 aircraft for which application for certification is made."
Certification basis,"CAR 10. Type Certificate No. 7A9 issued December 2, 1960. 
 Date of Application for Type Certificate November 20, 1956. 
 Each aircraft and any replacement parts manufactured in the U.K. must be 
 designated as ""import"" and clearly labeled as such in accordance with CAR 
 10.30. A U.S. Airworthiness Certificate may be issued on basis of a U.K. Certificate 
 of Airworthiness for Export signed by a representative of the Ministry of Aviation 
 containing the following notation: ""The aeroplane covered by this certificate has 
 been examined and found to comply with British Civil Airworthiness Requirements 
 (1956) and the Special Requirements for Argosy notified by the U.S.A. Government 
 to the Government of the U.K. and conforms to TC 7A9."" (This certification 
 equivalent to CAR.4b effective December 31, 1953, plus Amendments 4b-1 
 thru 4b-10 inclusive and SR-422B dated July 9, 1959). 
 Compliance with the ditching requirements has been demonstrated. 
 Compliance with ice protection requirements has been demonstrated."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. 
 Approved equipment is shown in Armstrong Whitworth Schedule of Equipment 
 TP.30. The following additional equipment is required: 
 (a) Stall Warning Indicator, SafeFlite Part Nos. C.72907, C.72902 
 and C.72906/2."
Service Information,"Service bulletins, structural repair manuals, vendor manuals, aircraft flight 
 manuals, and overhaul and maintenance manuals, which contain a statement that 
 the document is CAA approved, or CAA approved through the Manufacturers CAA 
 Approval Ref. DAI/1103/38, or DAI/1011/55 on or after March 1, 1990, are 
 accepted by the FAA and are considered FAA approved. These approvals 
 pertain to the type design only."
NOTE 1,"(a) 
 Current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in the certificated empty 
 weight, and loading instructions when necessary, must be in each aircraft at the time of original 
 certification and at all times thereafter (except in the case of operators having an approved weight 
 control system). 
 (b) 
 ""Unusable Fuel and System Oil"" and all hydraulic fluid must be included in the certificated empty 
 weight. Unusable fuel is that quantity of fuel in the system and in the tanks which is unavailable to 
 the engine under critical flight conditions as defined in CAR 4B.416. This unusable fuel includes 
 ""system fuel"" which is defined as the quantity required to fill the system and tanks to the tank outlet 
 level when the airplane is in the ground level attitude. The fuel gauges are calibrated with the 
 unusable fuel level as the zero datum. The total amount of fuel is as follows: 
 Usable fuel 
 Unusable fuel 
 @ 6.75 lb./gal. 
 @ 6.75 lb./gal. 
 3939 U.S. gal. 
 30 U.S. gal. 
 System Oil is that amount of oil required to fill the oil systems and tanks which is not available for 
 normal engine lubrication. The propeller feathering oil is not considered usable oil and is included in 
 ""System Oil:. System oil weight is 65 lb. The oil tank capacity shown in this data sheet is the total oil 
 for which the tanks are placarded. Dipstick readings indicate the amount of oil required to fill the 
 tank."
NOTE 2,"Refer to the ""List of Fatigue and/or Throw Away Lives of Components or Assemblies"", in the 
 Argosy 650, Series 100 Maintenance Schedule, Publication No. T.P. 18, Revision No. 44 dated 
 December 1969 or a later ARB-approved issue for the retirement lives of the airplane parts 
 which are critical from the fatigue standpoint. These values of retirement or service life cannot be 
 increased without FAA Engineering approval."
NOTE 3,"All aircraft must be maintained and repaired in accordance with the Air Registration Board approved 
 Maintenance and Structural Repair Manuals."
NOTE 4,"Ferry permits may be issued to Argosy Type AW650 aircraft on which one engine is inoperative, with 
 its propeller removed or feathered under the following conditions: 
 Operation of aircraft shall be in accordance with pertinent limitations contained in the applicable 
 portion of the approved Airplane Flight manual, pertinent appendices and existing instructions."
NOTE 5,"Aircraft without the emergency exit in the roof of the rear fuselage (modification No. 13ANB) are 
 eligible for cargo operations only and a maximum crew of five."
NOTE 6,A FAA Certificate of Airworthiness is not to be issued until compliance is found to SFAR 88.
