 (b) Falcon 2000EX EASy Definition (Approved June 21, 2004)"
"EASy designation for Falcon 2000EX does not correspond to a model designation. This is only a commercial 
 designation for airplanes on which Major modification numbers M1691, M1745, and M1504 have been embodied. 
 Major Change Modification number M1691 to the Falcon 2000EX consists of the installation of an Enhanced Avionics System 
 (EASy) based on the Honeywell “Primus EPIC” product line. This system architecture is mainly built around 2 cabinets called 
 Modular Avionics Units (MAU), 2 Modular Radio Cabinets (MRC), 2 Audio panels, 2 reversionary panels and 4 14.1 inch 
 Liquid Crystal Displays. The pilots have access to the system using the 2 CCDs with multipurpose knob, menu pushbutton, 
 M1504 installs an ""All falcon Common pressurization system"" 
 M1691, M1745, and M1504 are basic on all Falcon 2000EX aircraft serial numbers 6, 28 and subsequent. 
 All parameters listed in the preceding sub-section (a) for the basic Falcon 2000EX remain valid for airplanes which incorporate 
 M1691 M1745 and M1504 
 (c) Falcon 2000DX Definition (Approved October 3, 2007) 
 The DX definition of the Falcon 2000EX does not correspond to a model designation. The Falcon 2000DX is only a commercial 
 designation for Falcon 2000EX airplanes in the EASy configuration on which modifications M3000 and M3001 are installed at 
 production. Modification M3000 defines the airplane and reduces the fuel tank capacity. Modification M3001 installs a new 
 fuel quantity indication system 
 M3000 and M3001 are basic on all Falcon 2000EX airplanes in the EASy configuration starting with serial number 601 and 
 subsequent 
 All parameters listed in the preceding sub-section (b) above for the Falcon 2000EX EASy remain valid for airplanes which 
 incorporate M3000 and M3001, except for the following weight limits and useable fuel.

 (d) Falcon 2000LX Definition (Approved April 29, 2009) 
 The LX definition of the Falcon 2000EX does not correspond to a model designation. The Falcon 2000LX is only a commercial 
 designation for Falcon 2000EX airplanes in the EASy configuration on which modifications M2846 and M3229 are installed. 
 Modification M2846 incorporates winglets on the airplane and M3229 installs new slats.
