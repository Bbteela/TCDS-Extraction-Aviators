 (revision #2), issued in conjunction with the pertinent airworthiness certificate. 
 (Exception: May be incorporated as a part of Air Carrier Operators Manual and must 
 be readily available to flight crew during operation of the aircraft.) The 
 performance and limitations sections of the Curtiss-Wright C-46E CAA Approved 
 Airplane Flight Manual (issued by Skyways International, Inc.) are directly 
 applicable to the C-46F without change. An Airplane Flight Manual based on those 
 sections of the C-46E manual, therefore, will be acceptable for use in C-46F aircraft.

 A current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in the certificated empty 
 weight, and loading instructions when necessary. (Exception: Air Carrier operators having an 
 approved weight control system).

 nameplate be removed from the aircraft. 
 (b) 
 The instruments should be marked for the approved limitations.

 located just aft of the firewall in each engine nacelle and should cut off all flow of oil to the engine 
 accessory compartment except that the shut-off should not prevent feathering the propeller.

 Notes: 
 (1) 
 The surface tabs should be balanced prior to balancing the control surface to 
 which they are attached. All control rods, etc., should be in their normal position 
 when balancing surface, but disconnected at the control surface horn. 
 (2) 
 (+) Plus unbalance indicates that the center of gravity of the control surface is 
 aft of the hinge line, i.e., T.E. heavy."
