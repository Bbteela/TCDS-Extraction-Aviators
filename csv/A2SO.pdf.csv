 an approve weight control system."
b,The airplane must be loaded so that the zero fuel weight c.g. is within the specified limits. See Figure 2.
c,"The weight of system fuel and trapped oil, as defined below and as listed in the Handbook of Weight and 
 Balance Data for the Model 300-50A-01 airplane, must be included in the airplane empty weight. 
 System Fuel (total unusable fuel): The weight of all fuel which is unavailable to the engines, the weight of fuel 
 remaining in the aircraft when the engines have consumed fuel down to the zero point on the fuel gauges, the 
 sum of ""drainable unusable fuel"" and ""trapped unusable fuel"" as defined below. 
 Drainable Unusable Fuel: The weight of fuel which can be drained from the airplane by the normal procedure 
 prescribed by the Handbook of Weight and Balance Data for the Model 300-50A-01 airplane, but which is 
 unavailable to the engines under flight conditions as prescribed by CAR 4b.416. 
 Trapped Unusable Fuel: The weight of fuel which can neither be drained by the normal procedures prescribed 
 by the Handbook of Weight and Balance Data for the Model 300-50A-01 airplane, nor consumed by the engines
