 Equipment List contains list of approved equipment in addition to equipment listed 
 in this specification.

 The airplane must be loaded so that the C.G. is within the specified limits at all 
 times, with the effects of fuel use, gear retraction, and movement of the crew and 
 passengers from their assigned positions being considered. (Model 340: Retraction

 (d) 
 The fuel capacity is the amount of fuel measured by the fuel gages with the airplane 
 in level attitude and tanks full. The ""unmeasurable fuel"" is approximately 15 U.S. 
 gallons, and is the amount of fuel remaining in the tanks when the fuel gages read 
 ZERO. The ""unmeasurable fuel"" must either be included in the airplane empty

 Note: All applicable Airworthiness Directives must be complied with. 
 (c) 
 Each airplane must satisfactorily pass an inspection for conformity to data sheet, 
 possible hidden damage, corrosion, workmanship and materials used in making any 
 repairs and/or alterations. 
 (d) 
 The maintenance, overhaul and modification records of each aircraft must be 
 reviewed for changes made by the military services that may affect the airworthiness 
 of the aircraft. Modifications and changes of equipment which affect the safety or 
 performance of the aircraft must be removed or approved by the Federal Aviation 
 Administration. 
 (e) 
 Instrument markings and placards must be installed as required by this Specification 
 and the pertinent Civil Air Regulation. 
 (f) 
 Each airplane must be weighed to determine its weight and balance, and an 
 approved loading chart or device installed. If changes have been made to the 
 original aircraft that may affect the flight characteristics or performance, the 
 particular aircraft must be flight tested by FAA to determine that the airplane as 
 modified will still meet the minimum requirements of CAR 4b in this regard. Upon 
 completion of the conversion to certified status, the manufacturer’s nameplate on the 
 aircraft should be altered to include the date of conversion and the new commercial 
 model designation. In case the original nameplate is not sufficiently large to include 
 this additional information, a similar plate should be installed near the original plate. 
 Under no circumstances should the original or any succeeding nameplate be altered 
 or removed from the aircraft. 
 (g) 
 An FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual must be provided for each aircraft."
