(a) Lear Model L-2C installation in accordance with Lear Dwg. 91250.,
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and loading 
 instructions when necessary, must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original certification. 
 The C.G. limits were determined with the landing gear extended. The airplane must be loaded so that its C.G. 
 position with the landing gear extended is always between the limits shown. 
 Each airplane must be weighed to determine its weight and balance prior to original certification."
NOTE 2,"Prior to certification as a civil aircraft, the following must be accomplished: 
 (a) Fuel System. The fuel cross-feed system must be either removed or disconnected from the fuel system or the 
 pressure cross-feed valve enclosed in a fuel and fume-tight box which is ventilated and drained to the outside. 
 (b) Engine Nameplate. When either of Items 108(e) to (f), inclusive, is installed, the engine nameplate must 
 have the following information added: “CAA Spec. No. 5E-1.”"
c Fuel and Oil Tanks,"(1) Each fuel and oil tank and/or the structure adjacent to the filler opening must be placarded for the 
 contents and capacity. 
 (2) When 87 octane fuel is used in order to utilize 450 hp. for takeoff, at least one fuel tank must be placarded 
 for 87 octane minimum. Tank selector valve placard then must designate the 87 octane fuel tank and state 
 that 87 octane must be used for takeoff. 
 (3) A satisfactory means of measuring the oil must be provided. 
 (d) Bombardier’s Seat. If this seat is retained an approved safety belt must be satisfactorily installed or the seat 
 placarded “not to be occupied during takeoff and landing.” 
 (e) Instruments. Instruments must be marked for approved operation limitations 
 (g) Automatic pilots. If Sperry A-5 or Minneapolis-Honeywell C-1 automatic pilot is installed, it must be 
 disconnected from the airplane flight control system. 
 (h) Gun Turret. A satisfactory enclosure must be provided to replace the gun turret if installed."
i,"The following placards must be displayed on the instrument panel in full view of the pilot: 
 (1) “This airplane shall be operated in accordance with Part I of the CAA approved Operating Manual 
 for the Model AT-11 airplanes. This manual shall be carried in the pilot’s compartment at all times.” 
 (2) “Intentional spinning prohibited.”"
j,"Cargo and Baggage Compartments. Both cargo and baggage compartments must be placarded for the 
 maximum permissible load and suitable tie-down provisions shall be installed in each compartment when 
 used as such. The forward compartment shall be confined to the pilot’s floor boards between the bombardier’s 
 seat and the instrument panel. Suitable provision must be made to isolate the contents from possible jamming 
 of the pilot’s controls. 
 (k) Emergency Exit. (See CAR 4a.462 for Requirements) - Present Army AT-11 (Navy SNB-1) airplanes can be 
 certificated for carrying a maximum of five persons. For more than five persons, an emergency exit complying 
 with CAR 4a.462 must be installed on the right side of the passenger compartment. If fuselage structural 
 members are altered to provide for the required exits, details of the alteration and substantiating structural data 
 should be forwarded to the Federal Aviation Administration, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 
 64106, for examination and approval."
l,"Passenger Seats. Passenger seats, flooring, and safety belt installations other than originally provided by the 
 manufacturer must be shown to meet the strength requirements of CAR 4a. 
 (m) Bomb Bay Doors. The bomb bay doors must be made inoperative. 
 (n) Master Switch. A master switch arrangement (accessible to the pilot or copilot) must be installed in order that 
 all electrical power, including batteries and generators, can be disconnected within approximately two feet of 
 the power source with one operation. 
 (o) Fuses. All fuses or circuit breakers for required equipment must be accessible to the pilot(s) for replacement or 
 resetting in flight, including radio fuse. 
 (p) Landing Light Circuit. If the landing lights are retained the circuit must be revised to provide adequate circuit 
 protection in the motor circuit. The installation of an additional fuse (15 ampere cap.) in the motor circuit is 
 satisfactory."
q Rudder Trim Tab,"(1) The rudder trim tab area must be increased by modification in accordance with the Figure 1 below: 
 REAR TAB TRAILING EDGE RIVETS DRILLED OUT 
 AND TRIM TAB EXTENSION INSERTED ON INSIDE 
 AND RIVETED IN PLACE WITH 1/8” AD RIVETS 
 (2) Dual rudder tabs per Beech Dwg. 404-000010 sheet six may be installed in lieu of the tab 
 extension - required in (q) (1) above. 
 (r) The following additional items must be complied with for night operation: 
 (1) Remove the resistors installed in the position light circuits and replace single pole double throw 
 position light switch with a single pole throw switch. 
 (2) Replace the wing position lights with certificated units or satisfactorily modify the lights, if pertinent. 
 Note: Type A-9 wing position lights (AN-3033-5 through -8) may be satisfactorily modified by painting 
 the inside of the frosted glass cover black. 
 (3) The tail light must be replaced with a certificated unit. 
 (4) The amber glass of the tail warning light must be replaced with a clear cover glass, otherwise this light 
 must be made inoperative. 
 (s) If the engines do not incorporate an .010 inch radius at the root of the crackshaft thrust bearing nut threads as 
 outlined in P&WA Service Bulletin No. 1488, the dye penetrant inspection of the subject area described under 
 “Note” in AD 57-5-4 must be accomplished even though no oil leakage of the front section is noted."
t,"Install wing spar strap which reinforces the lower spar cap from LWS 181 to RWS 181. 
 Consult STC Summary or applicable AD’s for eligible installation."
