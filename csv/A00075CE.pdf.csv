 EASA certification of compliance with the aforementioned certification basis, and in 
 accordance with the standard airworthiness certificate provisions of FAR 21.183(c). 
 Note: The airworthiness provisions of FAR 21.183(d) may be cited as the basis for 
 issuance of standard airworthiness certificates for aircraft imported from a country other 
 than the country of manufacture."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for standard airworthiness 
 certification. In addition, the following items of equipment are required: 
 a) 
 Pre-stall warning indicator, Safe Flight Instrument Corp. Type 164R, or equivalent. 
 b) 
 EASA approved Aircraft Flight Manual (EASA approval No. 10057053)."
Import requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export Certificate 
 of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the Ente Nazionale per 
 l’Aviazione Civile (ENAC) on behalf of the European Community. The Export C of A 
 should contain the following statement: “The aircraft covered by this certificate has 
 been examined, tested, and found to comply with TC No. EASA.A.613 approved under 
 U.S. Type Certificate No. A00075CE and to be in a condition for safe operation”. 
 Country other than Manufacturer (U.S. bilateral agreement and the original Export 
 Certificate of Airworthiness issued by the country of manufacture must exist): A U.S. 
 airworthiness certificate may be issued on the basis of a log book certifying statement 
 endorsed by an authorized representative of the civil aviation authority of the exporting 
 country. It is incumbent upon the exporting civil aviation authority to determine that the 
 certifying statement includes evidence of acceptable service history and modification 
 deviations and the following statement: ""The aircraft covered by this certificate has been 
 examined, tested, inspected in accordance with the provisions of FAR 21.183(d) or its 
 equivalent, and found to conform to the type design approved under Type Certificate 
 A00075CE and is in a condition for safe operation"". 
 For issuance of an airworthiness certificate in accordance with 14 CFR Part 21.183(c), 
 the Ente Nazionale per l’Aviazione Civile of Italy must certify that the airplane 
 conforms to the type design and is in a condition for safe operation. The Ente Nazionale 
 per l’Aviazione Civile of Italy will certify that the airplane complies with all applicable 
 mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) it has issued. 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness 
 (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification 
 of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported 
 aircraft."
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the European 
 Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or - for approvals made before September 28, 2003 - 
 by the Ente Nazionale per l’Aviazone Civile (ENAC). (These approvals pertain to the 
 design data only). 
 Service Bulletins 
 Structural Repair Manuals 
 Vendor Manuals 
 Aircraft Flight Manuals, and 
 Overhaul and Maintenance Manuals 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved unless 
 one of the following conditions exists: 
 - 
 The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures 
 of the FAA approved manuals; or 
 - 
 The documents make an acoustical or emissions change to this 
 product’s U.S. type certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. 
 The FAA may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to approve on behalf of the 
 FAA for the U.S. type certificate. If this is the case it will be noted on the 
 document."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment in certificated empty weight, and loading 
 instructions, must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original airworthiness certification. 
 The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of gravity location must include unusable fuel (15.9 lb. at 
 +25.6 in.)."
NOTE 2,"a) 
 The following placards must be displayed in full view of the pilot:

 MARKINGS AND APPLICABLE FLIGHT MANUAL” 
  
 “MAXIMUM TAKE-OFF WEIGHT OF 1155 Kg (2546 lb.) IS ALLOWED ONLY IF THE LANDING 
 WEIGHT CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF FUEL CONSUMPTION IS NOT HIGHER THAN 1100

 In addition, all placards required in the EASA approved Airplane Flight Manual must be installed in the 
 appropriate location. 
 b) 
 Each individual airplane must be equipped with a placard that specifies the kind of operation such as VFR, or
