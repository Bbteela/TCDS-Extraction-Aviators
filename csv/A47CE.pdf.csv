 The Austro Control Group (ACG) originally type certificated this aircraft under its Type 
 Certificate Number FZ021-JAA. Effective September 28, 2003, the European Aviation 
 Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this product under their Type Certificate 
 Number A.022 on behalf of Austria. Effective November 15th, 2017 this type certificate 
 was transferred to Diamond Aircraft Industries in Canada under the oversight of 
 Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA). 
 The FAA originally validated the model DA 40 airplane on August 15, 2001. Subsequent 
 to the transfer of the models DA 40, DA 40 F, and DA 40 NG from Diamond Aircraft 
 Industries GmbH (Austria) to Diamond Aircraft Industries Inc. (Canada), the FAA has 
 reissued Type Certificate A47CE on November 15, 2017."

 based on an NAA Export Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a 
 representative of the Austro Control Group (ACG) on behalf of the European Community. 
 The Export C of A should contain the following statement “The aircraft covered by this 
 certificate has been examined, tested, and found to comply with Code of Federal Regulations 
 Part 23 approved under U.S. Type Certificate No. A 47CE and to be in a condition for safe 
 operation”. 
 b) For new aircraft produced in Canada, a United States airworthiness certificate may be 
 issued on the basis of a Canadian Certificate of Airworthiness for Export signed by a 
 representative of the Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA), containing the following 
 statement (in the English language): ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been 
 examined, tested, and found to comply with U.S. type certificate No. A47CE and to be in a

 c) For used aircraft a United States airworthiness certificate may be issued based on a 
 Certificate of Airworthiness for Export from a country for which the FAA has entered into an 
 agreement or under procedures acceptable to the FAA. 
 d) The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 
 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR Sections 21.183(c) or 21.185(c).

 The Austro Control (ACG) originally type certificated this aircraft under its Type 
 Certificate Number FZ021-JAA. Effective September 28, 2003, the European Aviation Safety 
 Agency (EASA) began oversight of this product under their Type Certificate Number A.022 
 on behalf of Austria. Effective November 15th, 2017 this type certificate was transferred to 
 Diamond Aircraft Industries in Canada under the oversight of Transport Canada Civil 
 Aviation (TCCA). 
 The FAA originally validated the model DA 40 NG airplane on November 16, 2011. 
 Subsequent to the transfer of the models DA 40, DA 40 F, and DA 40 NG from Diamond 
 Aircraft Industries GmbH (Austria) to Diamond Aircraft Industries Inc. (Canada), the FAA 
 has reissued Type Certificate A47CE on November 15, 2017."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the airplane for 
 certification. 
 In addition, the following items of equipment are required: 
 DA 40 NG Airplane Flight Manual, Document No. 6.01.15-E, revision 1 dated June 15, 2011. 
 Maintenance Manual (including Airworthiness Limitation), Document No. 6.02.15 revision 1 
 dated June 15, 2011."
Import requirements,"a) For new aircraft produced in Austria, The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate 
 based on an NAA Export Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a 
 representative of the Austro Control (ACG) on behalf of the European Community. The 
 Export C of A should contain the following statement “The aircraft covered by this certificate 
 has been examined, tested, and found to comply with Code of Federal Regulations Part 23 
 approved under U.S. Type Certificate No. A 47CE and to be in a condition for safe operation”. 
 b) For new aircraft produced in Canada, a United States airworthiness certificate may be 
 issued on the basis of a Canadian Certificate of Airworthiness for Export signed by a 
 representative of the Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA), containing the following 
 statement (in the English language): ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been 
 examined, tested, and found to comply with U.S. type certificate No. A47CE and to be in a 
 condition for safe operation.’ 
 c) For used aircraft a United States airworthiness certificate may be issued based on a 
 Certificate of Airworthiness for Export from a country for which the FAA has entered into an 
 agreement or under procedures acceptable to the FAA 
 d) The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 
 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR Sections 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). 
 e) The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 
 21.29 exported from countries other than the country of manufacture (e.g., third party 
 country) is FAR Section 21.183(b) or 21.183(d). 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness (or 
 equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of 
 Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft."
