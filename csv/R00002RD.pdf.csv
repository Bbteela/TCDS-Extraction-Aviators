Import Requirements,"To be considered eligible for operation in the United States, each 
 aircraft manufactured under this Type Certificate must be 
 accompanied by a Certificate of Airworthiness for Export or 
 certifying statement endorsed by the exporting foreign civil 
 airworthiness authority which states the following (in the English 
 language): 
 “The rotorcraft covered by this certificate has been examined, 
 tested and found to conform to the type design approved under 
 FAA Type Certificate No. R00002RD and to be in condition for 
 safe operation.” 
 The only aircraft eligible for import into the United States are those 
 aircraft with the 4-displays configuration defined in LHs Report 
 No. 139G0000P005/02, “AB139 Type Design Definition – 4 
 Display Configuration,” and Report No. 139G0000P005/03, 
 “AW139 Type Design Definition – Long Nose Configuration.” 
 LHs reports 139G0000P005/02 and 139G0000P005/03 are 
 volumes 2 and 3 of the basic LHs report 139G0000P005, “AB139- 
 Type Design Definition,” Rev. H, dated June 7, 2007. (See NOTE 
 5). 
 Aircraft with a Laser Arm Interlock Panel installed are not eligible 
 for import. (See Note 14). 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for 
 import into the United States of both new and used aircraft based 
 on the scope of the agreement, to identify any required statements 
 by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness 
 (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating 
 exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to 
 FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for 
 requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for 
 imported aircraft."

 follows: Special Condition No. 29-0010-SC, High Intensity 
 Radiated Fields (HIRF), dated Feb. 19, 2004. 
 (5) Equivalent Level of Safety Findings issued against: 
 (a) 14 CFR 29.1305, as documented in AB139 FAA Memo 
 dated Dec. 20, 2004. 
 (b) 14 CFR 29.1321, as documented in AB139 FAA Memo 
 dated Dec. 20, 2004. 
 (6) Special Condition No. 29-027-SC for Search and Rescue 
 Automatic Flight Control System (See Note 16) 
 The Italian Civil Aviation Authority, ENAC, originally type- 
 certificated this rotorcraft under its Type Certificate Number A415. 
 The FAA validated this product under U.S. Type Certificate 
 Number R00002RD. Effective September 28, 2003, the European 
 Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this rotorcraft 
 on behalf of ENAC, under EASA Type Certificate Number R.006."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable 
 airworthiness regulations (See Certification Basis) must be 
 installed in the helicopter for certification. 
 See LHs Report No. 139G0840W002 - Equipment List or No. 
 139G0840W005 – Equipment List (Long Nose Configuration). 
 The installation of the following is mandatory for Category-A 
 operations: 
 - Service Bulletin P&WC S.B. 41020; and 
 - Honeywell Primus EPIC software P/N MM7030191-004 or 
 later approved software. 
 The installation of the following is mandatory for Single Pilot VFR 
 operations: 
 - Traffic Advisory System (TCAS), RFM Supplement 25 
 - Quick Reference Handbook (QRH), LHs Publication Code 
 502500032, latest issue; and 
 - Map / QRH Holder, P/N 4G2510F00111, P/N 
 4G2510F00113, or equivalent. 
 The installation of the following is mandatory for Night Vision 
 Goggle Operations: 
 - NVIS compatible lighting systems P/N 4G3360F00111; and 
 - Honeywell Primus EPIC software version 4.8 or later approved 
 software. 
 The installation of the following is mandatory for operating in 
 icing conditions: 
 - Full Ice Protection System kit (P/N 4G3000F00211) 
 Refer to approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual for other approved 
 mandatory and optional equipment."
Service information,"Leonardo Service bulletins, structural repair manuals, vendor 
 manuals, aircraft flight manuals, and overhaul and maintenance 
 manuals, which contain a statement that the document is 
 (ENAC/EASA) approved, are accepted by the FAA and are 
 considered FAA approved. These approvals pertain to the 
 approved type design only."
Flight Manual,"ENAC/EASA approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual (4-Display 
 Configuration), 139G0290X002, dated November 25, 2004, or 
 later approved revision (See NOTE 5 and NOTE 17)."
Maintenance Manual,"Maintenance Planning Information 39-A-AMPI-00-P 
 Maintenance Publication 39-A-AMP-00-P."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including loading instructions and list of equipment included in the certificated 
 empty weight, must be provided for each helicopter at the time of original airworthiness certification."
NOTE 2,All placards indicated in the approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual must be installed in the appropriate location.
NOTE 3,"Information essential to the proper maintenance of the helicopter is contained in the Manufacturer’s Maintenance 
 Manual provided with each helicopter. Life limited components and associated retirement times are presented in 
 Chapter 4 and must be replaced in accordance therewith."
NOTE 4,"The model AB139/AW139 rotorcraft employs electronic engine controls, commonly named Full authority Digital 
 Engine Controls (FADEC), that are recognized to be more susceptible to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) than 
 rotorcraft that have non-electronic controls. (EMI may be the result of radiated or conducted interference.) For this 
 reason modifications that add or change systems that have the potential for EMI, must either be qualified to a 
 standard acceptable to the FAA or tested at the time of installation for interference with the FADEC. This type of 
 testing must employ the particular FADEC diagnostic techniques and external diagnostic techniques. The test 
 procedure must be FAA approved."
NOTE 5,"The FAA Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) is identical to the ENAC/EASA approved RFM with exceptions for 
 Minimum Flight Crew limitations and identification of Noise Characteristics. Unique FAA approved pages are 
 marked as “FAA Approved” and must be included in the FAA manual to reflect the differences noted below: 
 1. Section 1, LIMITATIONS, MINIMUM FLIGHT CREW: 
 Requires two pilots for VFR and two pilots for IFR. For Single Pilot VFR operations, refer to RFM Supplement 
 32.

NOTE 6,"The LHs Model AB139/AW139 incorporates an integrated avionics system using software-based line replaceable 
 units (LRU) which share a digital signal transmission bus. The software configuration of the AB139/AW139, as 
 delivered from production, is critical to the proper operation of the avionics and cockpit instrumentation system. 
 Modification to the LRU software supplied with the AB139/AW139, replacement of an LRU with a different LRU, 
 addition of new LRU, or alteration of an LRU interface could adversely affect the airworthiness of the certified 
 software. No changes to the integrated avionics system should be made without coordination with the FAA Aircraft 
 Certification Office (ACO) having jurisdiction over the modifier."
NOTE 7,"The hydraulic fluids must conform to MIL-PRF-83282 or MIL-PRF-5606 which is an alternate for low Temperature 
 operation - see LIMITATIONS Section of the approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual. The Landing Gear Shock 
 Absorber must be filled only with MIL-PRF-5606."
NOTE 8,"Any changes to the type design of this helicopter by means of an amended type certificate (TC), supplemental type 
 certificate (STC), or amended STC, requiring instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA's) must be submitted 
 thru the project aircraft certification office (ACO) for review and acceptance by the Fort Worth -Aircraft Evaluation 
 Group (FTW-AEG) Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) prior to the aircraft delivery, or upon issuance of the 
 first standard airworthiness certificate for the affected aircraft, whichever occurs later as prescribed by Title 14 CFR 
 21.50. Type design changes by means of a field approval that require ICA's must have those ICA's reviewed by the 
 field approving FSDO."
NOTE 9,"The AB139 and AW139 are two names of the same product. They identify two production batches manufactured in 
 conformity with the same Type Design.
