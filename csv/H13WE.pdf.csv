 Note: In accordance with FAR 36.1(a)(4), compliance with the noise requirements has 
 been shown for Garlick Models UH-1B and UH-1H. No determination has been made by 
 the Federal Aviation Administration that the noise levels of this aircraft are or should be 
 acceptable or unacceptable for operation at, into, or out of, any airport. 
 Any alteration to the helicopter for Special Purposes not identified above require further 
 FAA approval and in addition, may require additional noise and/or flight testing. 
 UH-1B 
 General Note: Any subsequent modifications to the helicopter type certified under this 
 Type Certificate are to have the certification basis for that modification established under 
 14 CFR 21.101 published June 7, 2000 which became effective June 10, 2003. 
 Otherwise non-significant modifications are to meet the requirements of CAR 7 
 airworthiness standards, including Amendment 7-5, effective May 1962 plus special 
 conditions for turbine engine installations and 14 CFR 29.1529, Instructions for 
 continued airworthiness, Amendment 20, effective September 11, 1980. Also should 
 consider that military installed crashworthy fuel systems in some of these aircraft and 
 should require that to be maintained.
