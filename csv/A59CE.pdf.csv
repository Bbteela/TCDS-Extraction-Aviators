Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations (see 
 Certification Basis) must be installed in the airplane for certification."
Service Information,"Service bulletins, structural repair manuals, vendor manuals, AFMs, and overhaul and 
 maintenance manuals, which contain a statement that the document is approved by ANAC are 
 accepted by the FAA and are considered FAA approved. (These approvals pertain to the 
 design data only)."
NOTES,"NOTE 1. A current weight and balance report, including a list of equipment included in the 
 certificated empty weight, and loading instructions when necessary must be provided for 
 each aircraft at the time of original certification. 
 The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of gravity location must include:
