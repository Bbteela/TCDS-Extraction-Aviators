 conditions have been satisfied. 
 (a) Aircraft records must indicate, or a determination must be made, that the aircraft has been 
 subjected to FAA initial screening inspection. The screening inspection record must show that 
 the aircraft has a reasonable potential for standard certification. (Those aircraft dispositioned as 
 having no reasonable potential for standard certification are not certifiable unless the reasons 
 for no reasonable potential can be reconciled. These aircraft are sold by U.S. Department of 
 Defense only for the purpose of “Recovery of Parts or Reduction to Scrap.”)

 Certificate or other methods acceptable to the FAA.

 have been met, a U.S. Standard Airworthiness Certificate may be issued. Certification basis is FAR 
 21.183(c) since these are import aircraft.

 Canada Limited. Inquiries for this data should be submitted to The Product Support Department, 
 deHavilland of Canada, Limited, Downsview, Ontario, Canada."
