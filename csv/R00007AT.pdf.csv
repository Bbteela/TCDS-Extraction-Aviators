Certification Basis,"FAR 21.25(a)(2) effective February 1, 1965, with Amendment 21-42, dated January 6, 
 1975. 
 Type Certificate No. R00007AT was issued September 5, 1995, for the purpose of: 
 1. Agricultural aircraft operations (as defined in FAR 137.3), 
 2. Dispensing firefighting materials, 
 3. Carriage of external loads (as defined in FAR 133.1(b)). 
 These helicopters have not been shown to comply with the noise requirements of FAR 
 36 and are, therefore, limited to the three special purpose operations listed above per 
 FAR 36.1(a)(4). 
 Date of application for Type Certificate: May 25, 1995. 
 Prior to original airworthiness certification of each rotorcraft, FAA personnel must 
 perform an airworthiness inspection determining condition for safe operation and 
 determine the applicant has conducted a satisfactory flight test."
Production Basis,None. No helicopters may be produced under this approval.
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the following documents must be in 
 each type helicopter for certification: 
 a. U.S. Air Force T.O. 1H-3(C)E-1 Flight Manual 
 b. Current Weight and Balance Report (see Note 1). 
 c. A placard must be installed in clear view of the pilot as follows: 
 ""MAXIMUM LANDING WEIGHT IS 19,500 LBS."""
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report, T.O. 1H-3(C)E-5, including list of equipment included in 
 certificated empty weight, and loading instructions, must be in each helicopter at time of original 
 airworthiness certification, and at all times thereafter."
NOTE 2,"Helicopter shall be maintained in accordance with USAF T.O. 1H-3(C)E-6, Organizational 
 Maintenance and Inspection Program, or other FAA approved inspection program."
NOTE 3,"Helicopter shall be operated in accordance with USAF T.O. 1H-3(C)E-1 (see Section V for operational 
 limits)."
NOTE 4,"Prior to civil certification, the following must be accomplished for each helicopter: 
 USAF Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO's) and FAA Airworthiness Directives (AD's) must 
 be reviewed for applicability and complied with accordingly. TCTO's issued prior to the issuance of 
 USAF T.O. 1H-3(C)E-2-1, dated February 21, 1991, or later edition, will already be incorporated into 
 the maintenance manual. Only those TCTO's issued after USAF T.O. 1H-3(C)E-2-1 need to be 
 reviewed for applicability. See Robinson Air Crane, Inc. Report 001 for the list of applicable AD's and 
 TCTO's for each approved serial number."
NOTE 5,"Continued airworthiness of the USAF CH-3C, HH-3C, CH-3E, HH-3E helicopters eligible under this 
 TCDS is contingent upon compliance with all applicable FAA Airworthiness Directives for the 
 Sikorsky Model S61R helicopters, the General Electric CT-58 (Military Model T-58) 
 engine, and any components installed thereon."
NOTE 6,"This approval applies to: 
 a. Basic Surplus Military Models CH-3C, HH-3C, CH-3E, HH-3E helicopters with no modifications 
 except as required by Robinson Air Crane, Inc. Report RAC-002, dated May 25, 1995, or later FAA 
 approved revision. 
 b. Only those helicopters with USAF serial numbers listed in Robinson Air Crane, Inc. Report 003, 
 no revision, dated September 5, 1995, or later FAA approved revision."
NOTE 7,Limited life schedule for helicopter components is included in USAF T.O. 1H-3(C)E-6.
NOTE 8,"Only Ribbed-Pocket Tail Rotor Blades, Sikorsky P/N S6117-30101-( ), may be installed."
