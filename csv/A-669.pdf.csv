 prior to delivery from the factory. 
 Prior to certification as a civil aircraft, the following must be accomplished: 
 (a) Each airplane must satisfactorily pass an inspection for conformity, possible hidden damage, and for 
 workmanship and materials used in making any repairs and/or alterations. All Airworthiness Directive 
 Notes must be complied with. 
 (b) Instrument markings and placards must be installed as required by this specification and commercial DC-3 
 practice. Attention should be given to the windshield equipment and it should be determined that a 
 satisfactory windshield wiper is installed. 
 (c) The following military equipment should be removed: Winterization (except oil dilution system and 
 hopper oil tanks), propane priming, glider tow mechanism in the tail cone, litter boxes, litters, and 
 supporting structure. Such brackets and supporting structure as will not interfere with the safe operation 
 of the aircraft may, at the operator's discretion, be left in the aircraft as long as the equipment has been 
 rendered inoperative. 
 (d) Each airplane must be weighed to determine its weight and balance and an approved loading chart or 
 device installed. If any changes have been made which would adversely affect the flight characteristics, 
 the particular airplane must be flight tested. 
 (e) If bullet sealing fuel cells are installed, the following must be complied with: 
 (1) Inspect the installation to ascertain that tanks are adequately supported, i.e., that tank when empty, 
 retains approximately its full shape and such that the weight of the fuel or cell will not cause sagging 
 or pulling on any connections. 
 (2) Check tank capacities and gauges. Tanks of this type are known to vary considerably in volume and 
 the main cells may vary from 180 to 200 gallons capacity while the auxiliary cells may vary from 165 
 to 180 gallons capacity. Gauges and pertinent placards must show correct capacity for cells actually 
 installed. Upon completion of the conversion to certificated status, the manufacturer's nameplate on 
 the aircraft should be altered to include the date of conversion and the new commercial model 
 designation. In case the original nameplate is not sufficiently large to include this additional 
 information, a similar plate should be installed near the original plate. Under no circumstances 
 should the original or any succeeding nameplate be removed from the aircraft."
NOTE 8,"Models DC3C-SC3G, DC3C-S1C3G and DC3C-S4C4G (Army C-47, C-47A; Navy R4D-1, R4D-5) are 
 basically the same as models DC3A-SC3G, DC3A-S1C3G and DC3A-S4C4G, respectively. The DC3C-R- 
 1830-90C (C-47B, Navy R4D-6) is basically the same as the C-47A (Navy R4D-5) except for engine 
 installation. Certain production changes have been made in some of the aircraft such as forged engine mounts, 
 forged landing gear trusses, rear brace struts, etc., all of which is interchangeable, are structurally satisfactory 
 for use on any DC3 aircraft. If an operator is doubtful as to the interchangeability of a part, he should contact 
 the manufacturer for his recommendations. 
 All C-47 or R4D-1 and C-47A or R4D-5 aircraft were constructed with a large fuselage door in the side to 
 permit loading of large pieces of cargo and the floors and floor beams were strengthened to support greater 
 loads than those in the standard DC3. The essential difference in the C-47 (R4D-1) and C-47A (R4D-5) is that 
 the latter model has a 24 volt electrical system instead of the 12 volt system which was standard on the C-47 
 (R4D-1) and other DC3 aircraft. All of the C-47 (R4D-1) and part of the C-47A (R4D-5) aircraft have the 
 steam heating system similar to the commercial DC3 aircraft, while the remainder of the C-47A (R4D-5) and 
 all of the C-47B (R4D-6) aircraft have a hot air heating system installed. 
 Prior to certification as a civil aircraft, the following must be accomplished: 
 (a) Each airplane must satisfactorily pass on inspection for conformity, possible hidden damage, and for 
 workmanship and materials used in making any repairs and/or alterations. All Airworthiness Directive 
 Notes must be complied with. It should also be determined that the production reinforced wing tips are 
 installed. The reinforced tip was installed at the factory on serial No. 9000 of the C-47 (R4D-1) aircraft 
 and all of the C-47A (R4D-5) aircraft (Serial No. 9150 and up) but no rework of the aircraft already in 
 service was ever required. The reinforced tip can be identified from the standard tip since the revisions 
 consisted in changing all stringers in the top surface from 1/2 x 7/16 x .040 to 7/8 x 1/2 x .051. All of the 
 short stringers on the top surface which originally ended in the bays between the ribs in many cases, have 
 been increased in length so that they will end at the rib. The five-inch doubler at the tip joint which was 
 originally .032 has been increased to .051 material. These changes became effective on the ""F"" change of 
 Douglas Dwg. 5115201. If the wing tips installed are not reinforced, they should be reworked as outlined 
 in Douglas Service Bulletin No. 215 dated September 14, 1943 and Supplement No. 1 dated November 
 30, 1943 and Douglas Service Letter to operators dated October 19, 1943. The reinforcement used in the 
 production tip is considered too difficult to accomplish in the field and should not be resorted to unless 
 satisfactory tooling is utilized. 
 Douglas Service Bulletins Nos. C-47-44, C-47-50, C-47-53, C-47-54, C-47-56 and C-47- 75 must be 
 complied with as well as all other applicable Airworthiness Directive NOTES not specifically mentioned 
 herein. In addition to the Service Bulletins mentioned above, Army Technical Orders 01-40NC-82 and 
 01-40NC-86 must be complied with on the Model C-47B (Navy R4D-6). 
 Some C-47 wing tips have been reinforced by installing .040 skin on the top surface from the wing tip 
 joint to station 398, and an .020 doubler over the .040 skin from the tip joint to station 368. The .020 
 doubler is outside the skin, and a tip reinforced in this manner can be easily recognized by inspection 
 without removing any inspection covers. Because of the tooling necessary to perform this rework, it is 
 recommended that this method of reinforcement not be done in the field. 
 (b) Instrument markings and placards must be installed as required by this specification and commercial DC3 
 practice. Attention should be given to the windshield equipment and it should be determined that a 
 satisfactory windshield wiper is installed. 
 (c) The following military equipment should be removed: Winterization (except oil dilution system and 
 hopper oil tanks), propane priming, glider tow mechanism in the tail cone, litter boxes, litters, and 
 supporting structure. Such brackets and supporting structure as will not interfere with the safe operaiton 
 of the aircraft may, at the operator's discretion, be left in the aircraft as long as the equipment has been 
 rendered inoperative. 
 (d) The non-ram air intake system, if installed, must be made inoperative and must be revised in accordance 
 with Douglas Dwg. 5115226 so as not to interfere with the carburetor hot air intake. 
 (e) If the aircraft is to be used in scheduled air carrier service, an approved flashing tail light system must be 
 installed. If certification is desired for night operations, all position lights should be approved type lights. 
 (f) A vacuum gauge or warning system equivalent to that used in commercial DC3 aircraft must be installed 
 in the instrument vacuum system. 
 (g) Flares and flare system as required for the particular operation must be installed. 
 (h) If the aircraft is to be used in air carrier service, the acceptability and airworthiness of any radio equipment 
 installed in the particular aircraft must be determined by the pertinent FAA offices. 
 (i) 
 NOTES 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 are pertinent to the operation of the airplane. 
 (j) 
 Any interior or exterior changes made to the primary structure or equipment must be made either 
 according to approved drawings for DC3 type aircraft or satisfactorily substantiated. 
 (k) Each airplane must be weighed to determine its weight and balance and an approved loading chart or 
 device must be installed. If any changes have been made which would adversely affect the flight 
 characteristics, the particular airplane must be flight tested. 
 (l) 
 On C-47A (R4D-5), C-47B (R4D-6) and C-117A aircraft having the hot air heating system installed, it 
 must be determined that the duct which carries hot air for cabin heating is insulated within the engine 
 nacelles. The following placard shall be installed near the heater warning light: ""Operate emergency 
 valves to spill hot air overboard when light is on."" 
 (m) If bullet sealing fuel cells are installed, the following must be complied with: 
 (1) Inspect the installation to ascertain that tanks are adequately supported, i.e., that tank, when empty, 
 retains approximately its full shape and such that the weight of the fuel or cell will not cause sagging 
 or pulling on any connections. 
 (2) Check tank capacities and gauges. Tanks of this type are known to vary considerably in volume and 
 the main cells may vary from 180 to 200 gallons capacity while the auxiliary cells may vary from 165 
 to 180 gallons capacity. Gauges and pertinent placards must show correct capacity for cells actually 
 installed. 
 Upon completion of the conversion to certificated status, the manufacturer's nameplate on the aircraft should 
 be altered to include the date of conversion and the new commercial model designation. In case the original 
 nameplate is not sufficiently large to include this additional information, a similar plate should be installed near 
 the original plate. Under no circumstances should the original or any succeeding nameplate be removed from 
 the aircraft."
NOTE 9,"The DC3D-R-1830-90C (Army C-117A) model aircraft is basically the same as the DC3C (Army C-47A)

 to the commercial DC3 aircraft, which have been installed. A 24-volt electrical system and a hot air heating 
 system are also incorporated instead of the 12-volt system and the steam heating system which were standard 
 on the commercial DC3 aircraft. 
 Prior to certification as a civil aircraft, the following must be accomplished: All modifications and inspections 
 detailed under NOTE 8(a) (first and second paragraphs only), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (j), (k), (l) and (m).

NOTE 13,"The following is applicable to airplanes certificated under the provisions of CAB Special Regulation SR-407: 
 Models DC3A, DC3C and DC3D aircraft have been determined to meet the structural requirements of CAR 4a 
 as amended April 7, 1950, for a maximum landing and take-off weight of 26,900 lbs., and may be certificated 
 for passenger carrying at weights up to and including 26,900 lbs., when P&W R-1830 series engines are 
 installed whose maximum continuous hp does not exceed 1100 and whose T.O. hp does not exceed 1350, 
 provided that the total weight of the engine-propeller installation forward of the firewall does not exceed 2500 
 lbs. and the following are accomplished: 
 (a) The structural modifications and installation of tires and wheels in accordance with NOTE 10(b) are 
 required if the landing weight exceeds 25,200 lbs. or the take-off weight exceed 26,200 lbs. 
 (b) If not already accomplished, the center wing spars, the tank covers on the bottom of the center wing and 
 the nacelle to wing attach angles must be reworked in accordance with Douglas Project Sketches 10826, 
 10827, 10828 and 10829 and Douglas Dwg. No. 5162328 on the following aircraft: All serial numbers up 
 to and including 1976, 1979 through 2003, 2009, 2011 through 2016 and 2019 through 2028. 
 (c) P&W R-1830 type engines having a maximum continuous hp not to exceed 1100 and a T.O. hp not to 
 exceed 1350 are installed. A forged engine mount per Douglas Dwg. No. 5110599 or welded engine 
 mount per Douglas Dwg. No. 5141024, is required. Except for the R-1830-94 which has been determined 
 to be satisfactory, engines incorporating two-speed supercharges must be locked in low blower unless 
 satisfactory cooling tests are conducted and any modifications found necessary to permit high blower 
 operation are incorporated. 
 (d) Any increase in power above 1200 hp must not adversely affect the flight characteristics of the airplane. It 
 has been determined that the directional controllability and stability of the DC-3 series aircraft is 
 inadequate in the one-engine out condition if engines having more than 1200 hp for take-off are installed. 
 Therefore, suitable modifications must be made to the airplane in a manner acceptable to the 
 Administrator, which will maintain flight characteristics equivalent to those previously approved. One 
 such modification which has been approved for a maximum of 1350 hp for take-off is a geared rudder tab 
 installation which is referred to in Item 602. 
 (e) An Airplane Flight Manual approved by the FAA is required and must be carried in the airplane at all 
 times. For airplanes using a maximum of 1200 hp for take-off, a maximum weight of 26,200 lbs. has been 
 established and may be approved without further tests. For airplanes using over 1200 hp up to 1350 hp 
 for take-off, if it is desired to increase the maximum weight above 26,200 lbs. to a maximum of 26,900 
 lbs., performance substantiation is required. 
 (f) The following airspeed (TIAS) limits are applicable: 
 Up to and including 
 Between 24,800 lbs. 
 Between 25,200 lbs. 
 24,800 lbs. 
 and 25,200 lbs. 
 and 26,900 lbs.

 (Flaps full) (45°) 
 112 mph ( 97 knots) 
 112 mph ( 97 knots) 
 112 mph ( 97 knots) 
 (g) The DC-3 series aircraft is not structurally satisfactory for take-off weight in excess of 26,900 lbs. 
 Therefore, if take-off weight, up to a maximum of 26,900 lbs., does not exceed the landing weight by 
 more than 105%, dump valves are not required. No allowance for de-icer installation will be permitted at 
 any weight. If an automatic pilot is installed in the airplane, satisfactory flight tests must be completed to 
 determine the effects upon the automatic pilot servo forces of any modification made to the airplane to 
 maintain its flight characteristics. The forces shown in Items 402(b) and (d) of this specification for the 
 Sperry A-12 and Pioneer PB-10 have been demonstrated to be satisfactory when a ""geared Rudder Tab"" 
 (See Item 602) is installed provided the maximum speed for operation of the automatic pilot is limited to 
 180 mph."
NOTE 14,"The following aircraft models are also eligible for an airworthiness certificate under this specification; DSTA- 
 SCG, -SC3G, -S1CG, -S1C3G and -S4C4G, serial numbers 1900 and up; DSTA-SB3G and -SBG, Serial 
 Numbers 1951 and up; DC3A-SB3G and -SBG, Serial Numbers 1600 and up."
NOTE 15,"Correct serial number for a particular airplane may be obtained from the manufacturer if suitable 
 information can be provided relative to its military identification, including military serial number. Page 13 of 
 Douglas Service Magazine for July 1946 contains a list of incorrect serial numbers versus Air Force numbers 
 and correct serial numbers for certain C47A, C47B and C117A aircraft."
