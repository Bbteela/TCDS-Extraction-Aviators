401,"(a) CAA (FAA) Approved Airplane Flight Manual, dated October 18, 1948 
 (b) Skiplane Supplement. When skis are installed the following supplemented 
 information shall be appended to the Airplane Flight Manual: 
 ""Performance Information with Ski Installation: 
 Climb: Skiplane climb performance is essentially equal to that of the 
 landplane. 
 Take-off and landing: Under the most favorable conditions of smooth packed 
 snow temperature approximating 30°F, skiplane take-off distance 
 approximately 20% greater than the landplane distance. In applying the 
 performance data, caution should be exercised in that lower temperatures 
 or other snow conditions will increase the ski friction and hence increase 
 the take-off and decrease the landing run."" 
 (c) When Item 2, 3, 4(a) or 5 propeller is installed, the Airplane Flight Manual shall 
 be revised to reflect this installation under 'Limitations' section and the following 
 statement added under 'Performance' section following Item 4: 
 ""5. Performance with the Model _______ propeller has been demonstrated to 
 equal or exceed that presented herein over the altitude and temperature 
 range shown.""
