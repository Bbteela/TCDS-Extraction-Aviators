Validation Basis,"The applicable airworthiness requirements for a U.S. certification under 
 14 CFR 21 section 21.29 identified above were established considering the 
 airworthiness requirements applied by the responsible exporting Polish civil 
 aviation authority under the Bilateral Aviation Agreement (BAA) authorized by 
 the Agreement between the Government of the Poland and the Government of 
 the United States of America, including the Amendment to the Annex, dated 
 February 9, 2004, that allows Commuter Category airplanes from Poland. 
 This Type Certificate was issued pursuant to the certification by the CAO that 
 the PZL Model M28 05 complies with the above requirements. 
 The CAO issued Polish Type Certificate No. BB-216, dated April 18, 2002, as 
 described in CAO TCDS No. BB-216 Revision 2, dated September 17, 2002."
Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export 
 Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the 
 Civil Aviation Office (CAO) of Poland on behalf of the European Community. 
 The Export C of A should contain the following statement: ‘The aircraft 
 covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to comply with 
 U.S. airworthiness regulations 14 CFR Federal Aviation Regulations Part 23, 
 U.S. Type Certificate No. A56CE and to be in a condition for safe operation.’ 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into 
 the United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the 
 agreement, to identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the 
 export certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures 
 for coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. 
 Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for 
 requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft. 
 SEE NOTE 6 – for limitation for icing equipment. Serial number AJE00310 
 and subsequent have the icing protection system (IPS) for inadvertent icing 
 encounters only installed at the factory. 
 Model PZL M28 05 airplane without any other letter associated on the model 
 designation and with serial numbers AJE00302 and subsequent are eligible for 
 a U.S. Standard Airworthiness Certificate. 
 Note: For example, if an airplane is model number M28 05 W, it is not eligible 
 for the U.S. Standard Airworthiness Certificate. 
 Note: M28 05 airplanes with the following serial numbers are not eligible for 
 U.S. Standard Airworthiness Certificate: 
 AJE001-XY (where XY equals 01 through 99); 
 AJE002-XY (where XY equals 01 through 99); 
 or AJE00-301 
 Note: The Serial number system of the M28 05 is as follows: 
 AJEUWXYZ 
 where the AJE is the article code of M28; the UWX is the series 
 number or production batch number (FIRST three digits) eg 003, 004 
 999, where 999 is highest possible number of production batch; 
 the YZ is the number of an airplane in series (last two digits) eg 
 01,02 .14 .99, where 99 is a highest possible number of an airplane in 
 one production batch."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the airplane for 
 certification. Such equipment is listed in the current FAA approved Airplane 
 Flight Manual (AFM), Revision 6, dated February 11, 2004, or later approved 
 revisions. Serial Number AJE00310 and subsequent that has the IPS, TCAS II 
 and Garmin GNS430AW systems installed at the factory must use AFM 
 revision 15, dated November 18, 2008 or later approved revisions.

 October 24, 2005 – by the Civil Aviation Office (CAO) of Poland. 
 • Service bulletins, 
 • Structural repair manuals, 
 • Vendor manuals, 
 • Aircraft flight manuals, and 
 • Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved for type 
 design data only unless one of the following conditions exists: 
 • The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures of the 
 FAA approved manuals; or 
 •The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this product’s 
 U.S. type certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. 
 The FAA may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to approve on behalf of the 
 FAA for the U.S. type certificate. If this is the case it will be noted on the 
 document. 
 Each airplane is provided with the following approved documents:

NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance data including list of equipment included in the 
 certificated empty weight and loading instructions, when necessary, must be 
 provided for each airplane at the time of original certification, and remain with 
 the airplane at all times thereafter. The certificated empty weight and 
 corresponding center of gravity locations must include the following: 
 Unusable fuel of 36 L (28 kg) {62 lbs.; 9.5 US gal}"
NOTE 2,"Airplane operation must be in accordance with the CAO approved Airplane

NOTE 6,"M28 05 airplanes with serial numbers (S/N) AJE00310 and subsequent have 
 type design change of installation of the ice protection system (IPS), approved 
 on non-hazard basis only, installed at the factory. These airplanes are not 
 approved for flight into known icing at this time. M28 05 airplanes with S/N 
 AJE00302 up to AJE00309 do not have this IPS for inadvertent icing 
 encounters and will only have the IPS if the manufacture develops a service 
 bulletin for retro fit at a later time. Currently no service bulletin exists. 
 NOTE 7. PZL life extension project was validated as FAA projects TD00415CE-A, 
 AT00705CE-A and AT00762CE-A. PZL electected to use later amendments of 
 several of the structures regulations. See certification basis for details. If 
 operators wish to extend their airframe service life to 25000 flight hours or 
 30000 takeoff- landings (whichever occurs first), they must incorporate SB 
 E/12.101R3/2014 (or later) and use chap 4 of Rev 52 of MM M28/10/2002
