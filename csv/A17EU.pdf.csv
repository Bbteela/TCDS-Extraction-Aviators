 Lateral leveling: straight edge across datum marks painted on wing above front spar."
Serial Numbers Eligible,"Each individual aircraft manufactured under this type certificate must be accompanied by 
 an Export Certificate of Airworthiness as noted below under ""Import Requirements"" when 
 an application for a U.S. airworthiness certificate is made. 
 BN2T-4R: C.2115 and C.2143."
Import Requirements,"Country of Manufacturer: A U.S. airworthiness certificate may be issued on the basis of an 
 Export Certificate of Airworthiness approved by an authorized representative of the Civil 
 Aviation Authority (CAA) United Kingdom including the following statement: 
 ""The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested and found to conform 
 to 14 CFR Part 23 type design approved under U.S. Type Certificate A17EU and to be in 
 a condition for safe operation."" 
 Country other than Manufacturer (U.S. bilateral agreement and the original Export 
 Certificate of Airworthiness issued by the country of manufacture must exist): 
 A U.S. airworthiness certificate may be issued on the basis of a log book certifying 
 statement endorsed by an authorized representative of the civil aviation authority of the 
 exporting country. It is incumbent upon the exporting civil aviation authority to determine 
 that the certifying statement includes evidence of acceptable service history and 
 modification deviations and the following statement: ""The aircraft covered by this 
 certificate has been examined, tested, inspected in accordance with the provisions of FAR 
 21.183(d) or its equivalent, and found to conform to the type design approved under Type 
 Certificate A17EU and is in a condition for safe operation."" 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United States of 
 both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any required statements by 
 the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for 
 procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to FAA 
 Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an 
 airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft."
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the European Aviation 
 Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before September 28, 2003 – by the United 
 Kingdom CAA. 
  
 Service bulletins, 
  
 Structural repair manuals, 
  
 Vender manuals, 
  
 Aircraft flight manuals, and 
  
 Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers the FAA-approved unless on of the 
 following conditions exits: 
  
 The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures of the FAA 
 approved manuals: or 
  
 The documents make an acoustical or emissions change to this product’s U. S. type 
 certificate as defined in 14 CFR 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. The FAA 
 may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to approve on Behalf of the FAA for the U.S. type 
 certificate. If this is the case it will be noted on the document."
