Certification Basis,"FAR 21.25(a)(2), effective February 1, 1965, for the special purpose of External 
 Load Operations under FAR 21.25(b)(7) (See note 17). Repetitive high torque 
 cycle events beyond the following are not approved: 
 (a) Two (2) Ground-Air-Ground (GAG) Cycles per Flight hour from rotors 
 stopped to Flight Conditions to rotors stopped. 
 (b) our (4) GAG Cycles per flight hour from rotors turning at ground idle (at 
 0% rpm) to flight conditions to rotors turning at ground idle (at 100% rpm). 
 GAG cycles in (a) and (b) above shall be applied independently 
 In accordance with FAR 36.1(a)(4), compliance with the noise requirements was 
 not shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this type certificate are only 
 eligible for external load operations excepted by FAR 36.1(a)(4) and defined

 identified above require further FAA approval and in addition, may require 
 noise and / or flight testing. 
 The aircraft certified under this type certification is accepted under the concept 
 of limited exposure associated with escape from inadvertent ice encounters and 
 is prohibited against flight into known icing. This Aircraft must be reevaluated 
 if certification to the General Ice Protection Airworthiness Regulations is 
 requested. 
 Any Subsequent modifications are to meet FAR 29 Airworthiness standards, 
 transport category Rotorcraft, as of Amendment Number 1, effective August 12, 
 1965 and FAR 29.1529, instructions for Continued Airworthiness, Amendment 
 number 20, effective September 11, 1980."
Date of Application,"November 29, 2000"
Production Basis,None. No helicopters may be produced under this approval. (See Note 4)

 The following equipment and documents must be available in each helicopter 
 for certification: 
 (a) U.S. Army TM55-1520-210-10, Operator’s Manual, UH-1H. 
 (b) Standard U. S. Army cargo suspension system installation, part numbers 
 204-070-900-5, 204-070-900-19, IAW TM55-1520-210-23P (Parts 
 Manual), installed and maintained IAW TM55-1520-210-23 (Maintenance 
 Manual), and operated IAW TM55-1520-210-10 (Operators Manual) for all 
 external cargo operations. 
 Notes"
Note 1,"A current weight and balance report including a list of equipment included in the certificated 
 empty weight, and loading instuctions, when necessary, must be provided for each aircraft at the 
 time of original certification. Refer to Operation’s Manual, TM55-1520-210-10, Chapter 6, and 
 Maintenance Manual, TM55-1520-210-23-1 Para. 1-38, for leveling means and weight and 
 balance determination."
