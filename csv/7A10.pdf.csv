NOTE 1,"(a) Current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and 
 loading instructions when necessary, must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original certification. 
 (b) ""Unusable fuel"" is that amount of fuel in the tanks which is unavailable to the engines under critical flight 
 conditions as defined in CAR 4b.416. This unusable fuel includes the ""system fuel"" which is defined as 
 the quantity required to fill the system and tanks to the tank outlet level when the airplane is in the ground 
 level altitude. The ""unusable fuel"" must be included in the airplane empty weight or be suitably accounted 
 for in the airplane weight and balance report. The total amount of fuel is as follows: 
 Usable fuel (lb.) 
 Unusable fuel (lb.) 
 71,165 
 384 
 ""System Oil"" is that amount of oil required to fill the oil system and tanks and is completely contained within 
 the engines. System oil weight is 58 lb. The oil tank capacity shown in this data sheet includes only the usable 
 oil. A sight glass allows to check the oil level."
