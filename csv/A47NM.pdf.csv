Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an Export Certificate of 
 Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the Swedish Civil 
 Aviation Administration (CAA). The Export C of A should contain the following 
 statement: ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and 
 found to conform with the Type Design approved under U.S. Type Certificate No. 
 A47NM and to be in a condition for safe operation. Compliance with Airworthiness 
 Directives (ADs) has been checked only for ADs issued by EASA, ADs adopted by 
 EASA and ADs published by FAA’ 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 14 
 CFR part 21, section 21.29, exported by country of manufacture is section 
 21.183(c) or 21.185(c) 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 
 section 21.29 exported from countries other than the country of manufacture 
 (e.g., third party country) is section 21.183(d) or 21.185(b). 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the 
 United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, 
 to identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the export 
 certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures for 
 coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to 
 FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements for 
 issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft."
Certification Basis,"14 CFR Part 25 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) as amended by 
 Amendment 25-1 through 25-71 except where superseded by: 
 - Sections 25.361, 25.365, 25.571, 25.772, 25.773, 25.783(g), 25.801, 
 25.905(d), 25.933, and 25.1419 as amended by Amendment 25-72. 
 - Sections 25.903 and 25.951(d) amended by Amendment 25-73. 
 - Sections 25.851 and 25.854 amended by Amendment 25-74. 
 - Section 25.729 amended by Amendment 25-75. 
 - Section 25.813 amended by Amendment 25-76. 
 14 CFR part 34, effective September 10, 1990. 
 14 CFR part 36 through amendment 36-20. Airplanes with SAAB 2000 Airplane 
 Flight Manual, revision 44 and above are certificated to 14 CFR part 36 through 
 amendment 36-30, Stage 4. 
 FAA equivalent safety findings exist with respect to the following: 
 - Use of 1-g stall speeds instead of minimum speed in the stall. Saab's letter 
 73CCS0435 dated March 13, 1993, which references NPA 25B-215, dated 
 July 1992 with follow-on changes, document equivalency. 
 - APU instrumentation and monitoring. Automatic features of the APU and the 
 indications provided by the Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System 
 (EICAS) described in Saab's document 73PAS0132A dated June 4, 1993, 
 provide equivalency to certain cockpit indications required by sections 
 25.1305 and 25.1501(b). 
 - Powerplant valve indication. The fuel system described in Saab document 
 73PPS0262, Rev. A, dated March 18, 1993, and indications provided by the 
 EICAS provides an equivalent level of safety to the powerplant valve position 
 indication requirement of section 25.1141. 
 FAA Special Conditions (S.C.): 
 - Interaction of Systems and Structure, S.C. No. 25-ANM-82 issued March 11, 
 1994, effective April 25, 1994; (Docket NM-91, 59 FR 13873 dated

 5571 dated January 22, 1993). 
 - Operation without Normal Electrical Power, Command Signal Integrity, and 
 Design Maneuver Requirements, S.C. No. 25-ANM-97 issued March 29,

 certificate Number A 1/94. The FAA validated this product under U.S. Type 
 Certificate number A47NM. Effective September 28, 2003, the European 
 Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this product on behalf of the 
 Swedish LFV. 
 14 CFR part 26 – Continued Airworthiness and Safety Improvements for 
 Transport Category Airplanes:
