NOTE 5,"This Type Certificate (TC) has been designated ""ABANDONED"". A “Notice of Intent To Designate as 
 Abandoned Certain Type Certificates Issued in the Restricted Category,” was published by the Federal 
 Aviation Administration (FAA) in the Federal Register on August 8, 2003 (68 FR 47379). That Notice listed 
 this TC. The FAA received no comments on the published Notice. The FAA has been unable to contact this 
 TC holder. Hence, the FAA has determined that this TC holder is not complying with its Continued 
 Operational Safety (COS) responsibilities. Therefore, no additional aircraft will be added to this TC and no 
 additional original airworthiness certificates will be issued based on this TC. The effectiveness of this TC is 
 limited to those aircraft that received original airworthiness certification prior to the incorporation of this 
 note (Date of Incorporation, January 24, 2005). Subsequently, if the TC holder is located and assumes their 
 COS responsibilities, the restriction(s) imposed by this note may be lifted."
