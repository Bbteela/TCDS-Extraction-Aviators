Import requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export Certificate 
 of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the the Ente Nazionale 
 per l’Aviazione Civile (ENAC) on behalf of the European Community. The Export C 
 of A should contain the following statement “ 
 The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to comply 
 with EASA TC No. A.385 approved under U.S. Type Certificate No. A 31EU and to be 
 in a condition for safe operation”. 
 Country other than Manufacturer (U.S. bilateral agreement and the original Export 
 Certificate of Airworthiness issued by the country of manufacture must exist): A U.S. 
 airworthiness certificate may be issued on the basis of a log book certifying statement 
 endorsed by an authorized representative of the civil aviation authority of the exporting 
 country. It is incumbent upon the exporting civil aviation authority to determine that 
 the certifying statement includes evidence of acceptable service history and modification 
 deviations and the following statement: ""The aircraft covered by this certificate has 
 been examined, tested, inspected in accordance with the provisions of FAR 21.183)d) or 
 its equivalent, and found to conform to the type design approved under Type Certificate 
 A31EU and is in a condition for safe operation"". 
 For issuance of an airworthiness certificate in accordance with 14 CFR Part 21.183(c), 
 The Ente Nazionale per l’Aviazione Civile of Italy must certify that the airplane 
 conforms to the type design and is in a condition for safe operation. The Ente 
 Nazionale per l’Aviazione Civile of Italy will certify that the airplane complies with all 
 applicable mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) it has 
 issued. 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into 
 the United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the 
 agreement, to identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the 
 export certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures 
 for coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. 
 Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for 
 requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft."
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the European 
 Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before September 28, 2003- 
 by the Ente Nazionale per l’Aviazone Civile (ENAC). (These approvals pertain to the 
 design data only).” 
 · Service Bulletins 
 · Structural Repair Manuals 
 · Vendor Manuals 
 · Aircraft Flight Manuals, and 
 · Overhaul and Maintenance Manuals 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved 
 unless one of the following condition exists: 
 · The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures 
 of the FAA approved manuals; or 
 · The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this 
 product’s U.S.type certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these 
 documents. The FAA may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to 
 approve on behalf of the FAA for the U.S. type certificate. If this is the 
 case it will be noted on the document."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment in certificated empty weight, and loading 
 instructions, must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original airworthiness certification.
