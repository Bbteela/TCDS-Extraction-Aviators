Import Requirements,"To be considered eligible for operation in the United States, each aircraft 
 manufactured under this type certificate must be accompanied by a certificate of 
 airworthiness for export or certifying statement endorsed by the exporting 
 foreign civil airworthiness authority which states (in the English language): 
 This aircraft conforms to its U.S. type design (Type Certificate No. A61EU) 
 and is in a condition for safe operation. 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft for aircraft type 
 certificated under FAR Section 21.29 and exported by the country of 
 manufacture is FAR Sections 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for 
 import into the United States of both new and used aircraft based on the 
 scope of the agreement, to identify any required statements by the 
 exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness (or 
 equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions 
 to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 
 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements for 
 issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft. 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 
 FAR Section 21.29 exported from countries other than the country of 
 manufacture (e.g., third party country) is FAR Sections 21.183(d) or 21.183(b)."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (see certification basis) must be installed in the aircraft for 
 certification. In addition, the following items are required: 
 SF600 
 a) 
 Pre-stall warning indicator, Safe Flight Instrument Corp., Type 164. 
 b) 
 Agusta SF600 Flight Manual, R.A.I. approved dated June 5, 1987 
 (Approval No. 231.129/T) or later R.A.I. approved revision. 
 c) 
 Engine Armoring Kit installed in accordance with Drawing 
 FI-504046. 
 SF600A 
 SF600A R.A.I. approved Airplane Flight Manual (600-00-38-03) dated 
 September 27, 1993 and subsequent approved revisions."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment in certificated 
 empty weight, and loading instructions, must be provided for each aircraft at 
 the time of original certification. 
 The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of gravity location 
 must include: 
 Unusable Fuel in internal tanks: 
 18 kg. (38.5 lbs.) 
 at 5.650 m. (222.4 in.) 
 Unusable Fuel in external tanks: 
 3 kg. (6 lbs.) 
 at 5.650 m. (222.4 in.) 
 Engine Oil (total): 
 for SF600 
 12 kg. (27 lbs.) 
 at 4.480 m. (176.4 in.) 
 for SF600A 
 15.85 kg. (35 lbs.) 
 at 4.48 m. (176.4 in.)"
NOTE 2,All placards required in the AFM must be installed in the appropriate location.
NOTE 3,"Instructions for Continued Airworthiness and Service Life Limits of 
 components are contained in the SF600A Maintenance Manual (SIAI Marchetti 
 Report 600-00-39-01). Revisions to Airworthiness Limitations must be FAA 
 approved. 
 All manufacturer’s service bulletins (and other manual material) which contain a 
 statement that the document is approved by the exporting airworthiness 
 authority (RAI) may be interpreted as FAA approved. These approvals pertain 
 to the type design only. 
 All service bulletins classified as Mandatory by the Italian Civil Aviation 
 Authority are identified to that effect and are subject to an Airworthiness 
 Directive issued by the FAA. 
 Aircraft eligible for a standard airworthiness certificate must not be issued an 
 airworthiness certificate unless the FAA has approved the Instructions for 
 Continued Airworthiness."
