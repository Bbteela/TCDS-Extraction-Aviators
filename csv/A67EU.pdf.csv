Import Requirements,"For aircraft produced in Germany, the FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness 
 certificate based on a Lufthaft Bundesamt (LBA) Export Certificate of 
 Airworthiness (Export C of A). The Export C of A should contain the 
 following statement, “The [insert aircraft MODEL] covered by this certificate 
 conforms to the type design approved under U.S. Type Certificate Number 
 A67EU, and is found to be in a condition for safe operation.” 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the 
 United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to 
 identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate 
 of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating 
 exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 
 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an 
 airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft."
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the 
 European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before 
 September 28, 2003 – by the Luftfahrt Bundesamt. 
 • Service bulletins, 
 • Structural repair manuals, 
 • Vendor manuals, 
 • Aircraft flight manuals, and 
 • Overhaul and maintenance manuals.The FAA accepts such documents 
 and considers them FAA-approved unless oneof the following 
 conditions exists: 
 • The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures of the 
 FAA approved manuals; or 
 •The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this product’s 
 U.S. type certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. 
 The FAA may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to approve on behalf of the 
 FAA for the U.S. type certificate. If this is the case it will be noted on the 
 document."
