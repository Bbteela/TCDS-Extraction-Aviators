 conditions established by the applicable Hamilton Standard Maintenance Manual. 
 b. 
 Propeller blade angles are indicated on the back-up valve housing under conditions established in the 
 applicable Lockheed Model 382 Maintenance Manual. 
 c. 
 1° blade angle is a running blade angle and corresponds to a static coordinator pointer position of 10° ± 
 1°. This position is obtained with the throttle lever in the ground idle aft detent. 
 d. For the Model 382J, propeller blade angles are measured at seventy percent of blade radius."
NOTE 4,"Auxiliary fuel tanks are eligible for installation in the Model 382B and 382E and 382F when installed

 the type of fuselage on initial issue of the standard airworthiness certificate. 
 EXAMPLES: 
 1. 
 382B-44B-17 contains 501-D22 engines and short fuselage. 
 2. 
 382E-44K-20 contains 501-D22A engines and has the 100 inch fuselage stretch. 
 3. 
 382F-44B-20 contains 501-D22 engines and has the 100 inch fuselage stretch. 
 4. 
 382G-44K-30 contains 501-D22A engines and has the 180 inch fuselage stretch 
 The Model numbers are specified in ER-206M, Addendum A. Incorporation of Supplemental Type 
 Certificate ST395SO modifies a 382B to 382E configuration and is noted with the installation of a

 data sheet and in the Airplane Flight Manual, Lockheed Publication AFM 382/E/G dated 
 August 30, 1978. Incorporation of Supplemental Type Certificate ST425SO modifies a 382B to a 382F 
 configuration and is noted with the installation of a modification data plate. The basic model remains 
 382B on the registration and airworthiness certificates. The modified airplane is operated in accordance 
 with the Model 382F data contained in the data sheet and in the Airplane Flight Manual, Lockheed 
 Publication SMP 760, dated 3 December 1969. Incorporation of Supplemental Type Certificate 
 ST446SO modifies a Model 382B to a 382G configuration and is noted with the installation of a 
 modification data plate. The basic model remains 382B on the registration and airworthiness 
 certificates. The modified airplane is operated in accordance with the Model 382G data contained in the 
 data sheet and in the Airplane Flight Manual, AFM 382/E/G, dated August 30, 1978. 
 The suffix -1C, -2C, etc., appearing on the aircraft data plate designates a customer peculiar configuration,
