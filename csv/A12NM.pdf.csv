DATA PERTINENT TO ALL MODELS,
Certification basis,"Federal Aviation regulations (FAR) Part 21.25(a)(2) and (b)(7), Amendments 21-1 
 through 21-56 effective February 8, 1982 
 The aircraft has been modified to Airnautica Inc. Drawing No. 1005 Revision N/C or 
 later FAA approved revision for the special purpose of carrying cargo in areas specified 
 in the FAA approved operations specification where standard aircraft are not reasonably 
 available to carry cargo and when the carriage of such cargo is incidental to the business 
 of the airplane owner, which is other than air transport."
Production basis,None.
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable Airworthiness Regulations 
 (See Certification Basis), must be installed in the aircraft for certification. 
 See Notes 3 and 4"
NOTE 1,"This approval applies to: 
 A. 
 Basic United States Air Force C-123B and C-123K airplane modified in accordance with Airnautica Inc. 
 Drawing No. 1005 Revision N/C or later FAA approved revision. 
 B. 
 Airplane certified for the special purpose of carrying cargo with the following limitations: 
 1. 
 The following placard must be displayed in the C-123B airplane in front of and in clear view of the 
 Pilot: 
 ""RESTRICTED CATEGORY"" 
 ""This airplane must be operated as a restricted category airplane in compliance with the operating 
 limitations stated in FAR 91.39, Section V of USAF T.O. 1C- 123B-1, and in the form of placards, 
 markings, and manuals. This aircraft is approved for the special purpose of carrying cargo. All cargo 
 must be loaded and restrained in accordance with USAF T.O. 1C-123B-9. 
 2. 
 The following placard must be displayed in the C-123K airplane in front of and in clear view of the 
 pilot: 
 ""RESTRICTED CATEGORY"" 
 ""This airplane must be operated as a restricted category airplane in compliance with the operating 
 limitations stated in FAR 91.39, Section V of USAF T.O. 1C- 123K-1, and in the form of placards, 
 markings, and manuals. This aircraft is approved for the special purpose of carrying cargo. All cargo 
 must be loaded and restrained in accordance with USAF T.O. 1C-123B-9. 
 3. 
 A red radial line is required on the airspeed indicator at 245 knots. 
 4. 
 Fuselage cargo compartments must be marked by a 1 inch wide white line from floor level to 
 60 inches above the floor. Compartment markings must include compartment designation, 
 compartment capacity and the allowable floor loading for the compartment in accordance with USAF 
 T.O. 1C-123B-5, Section III. Compartment markings must be white letters at least 1 inch high and 
 must be stenciled on the left and right side walls of the fuselage between 30 and 60 inches above the 
 floor. 
 5. 
 Carriage of hazardous materials is prohibited unless compliance is shown with the applicable 
 regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations 49, Part 175."
NOTE 2,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated weight empty, and 
 loading instructions must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter."
NOTE 3,USAF T.O. 1C-123B-1 must be available in the C-123B aircraft for all flight operations.
NOTE 4,USAF T.O. 1C-123K-1 must be available in the C-123K aircraft for all flight operations.
NOTE 5,The aircraft must be serviced and maintained in accordance with USAF T.O. 1C-123B-2-1.
NOTE 6,All cargo must be loaded and restrained in accordance with USAF T.O. 1C-123B-9.
NOTE 7,"The following note must be placed under ""exceptions"" on all Export Certificates of Airworthiness for this 
 aircraft. ""This aircraft is type certificated in the restricted category and may not meet the applicable 
 airworthiness code as provided by Annex 8 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation."""
NOTE 8,"Prior to obtaining an original airworthiness certificate: 
 A. 
 Each airplane must satisfactorily pass an inspection for conformity, possible hidden damage, and for 
 workmanship and materials used in making any repairs and/or alterations. 
 B. 
 The maintenance, overhaul, and modification records of each aircraft must be reviewed for changes made 
 by the military services that may affect the airworthiness of the aircraft. Modifications and changes of 
 equipment which affect the safety or performance of the aircraft must be approved by the Federal Aviation 
 Administration."
NOTE 9,"When operating the C-123B solely on 100/130 grade aviation gasoline follow the alternate fuel grade warning 
 limitation in Section V of USAF T.O. 1C-123B-1 and operational supplement T.O. 1C-123B-1S-42 dated 
 May 28, 1974."
NOTE 10,"To eliminate balancing difficulties, aluminum alloy propeller blades currently being repaired and stocked are 
 listed in two categories. At time of overhaul of blade assemblies, blades are balanced against a master balancer 
 meeting new blade specifications. Blades meeting the specifications retain the original blade designation. 
 Blades not meeting this specification will have the master drawing number identified by prefix letter R stamped 
 on the blade butt. All R blades are mated, and the mate blade serial numbers are stenciled on the outside 
 diameter of the blade butt. The mated set of blades is packaged and issued as a set and will not balance with 
 other blades. When replacement blades are required, check the identification. When R blades are required, a 
 complete set will be ordered. All other blades are interchangeable and may be requisitioned as required. 
 Reference T.O. 3-1-1)."
NOTE 11,"Flight characteristics of 43E60 propellers incorporating 6917F-14 or 7159B-14 blades are identical and 
 intermixing propellers on same aircraft is permissible. Basic difference is 6917F has basic design airfoil 
 thickness and square tip whereas the 7159B has increased airfoil thickness and round tip. Due to the difference 
 in airfoil thickness and tip design, the 6917F-14 and 7159B-14 blades will not be intermixed in the same 
 propeller assembly. (Reference T.O. 3-1-1)."
NOTE 12,"Maximum gross weight for the C-123K aircraft with no augmentation jets operating is 45,000 lbs."
NOTE 13,"No evaluation has been made of the overthrow straps, nets or cable used to restrain the cargo."
