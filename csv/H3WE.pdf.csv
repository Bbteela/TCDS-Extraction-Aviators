 The Hughes Model 369 (YOH-6A) and 369A (OH-6A) helicopters were only produced for and 
 delivered to military customers. To meet the basic eligibility requirements for a U.S. standard 
 and export airworthiness certificate, Hughes Model 369 (YOH-6A) and 369A (OH-6A) 
 helicopters must have been issued an FAA Form 8130-2 (previously FAA Form 970), “FAA 
 Conformity Certificate – Military Aircraft”, prior to delivery to the U.S. Army. Civil 
 conversion of these helicopters requires certain modifications to be made in accordance with 
 the applicable FAA approved type design data which forms the basis of Type Certificate 
 H3WE. 
 b) 
 Government furnished equipment identified in Hughes Report No. 369-X-0008, dated June 24, 
 1964 must be removed from Hughes Model 369 (YOH-6A) helicopters to be eligible for a U.S. 
 standard and export airworthiness certificate.

 5002, dated April 15, 1966 must be installed on Hughes Model 369A (OH-6A) helicopters to be 
 eligible for a U.S. standard and export airworthiness certificate. 
 d) 
 Information essential to the proper maintenance of the Hughes Model 369A (OH-6A) 
 helicopters is contained in the latest version of U.S. Army Technical Manual TM 55-1520-214- 
 23 and is applicable to civil converted Hughes Model 369A (OH-6A) helicopters. However, 
 civil conversion of these helicopters in accordance with the applicable NOTE 4.a) above will 
 result in configuration changes to these helicopters which are not included in TM 55-1520-214- 
 23. 
 Maintenance information associated with the configuration changes does not exist and must be 
 furnished and submitted, by the applicant for an airworthiness certificate, to the FAA Ft. Worth 
 Aircraft Evaluation Group (FTW-AEG) for review and acceptance prior to issuance of a U.S. 
 standard and export airworthiness certificate. See NOTE 3 and Service Life Limits section of

NOTE 14,"NOISE CHARACTERISTICS. Model 369D and 369E helicopters with the Rolls-Royce Corporation 
 (formerly Allison Engine Company) 250-C20B engine installed have not been tested for noise in 
 accordance with the requirements of FAR Part 36. Therefore, they are Stage 1 helicopters. Substitution 
 of Rolls-Royce Corporation 250-C20R/2 engine results in no acoustic change. Thus, Model 369D and 
 369E aircraft with the 250-C20R/2 engine installed are also Stage 1 helicopters. Model 369FF 
 helicopter with the Rolls-Royce Corporation 250-C30 engine has not been tested for noise in accordance 
 with the requirements of FAR Part 36, therefore, the Model 369FF is a Stage 1 helicopter.

VIII,"Data Pertinent to all Models (cont.) 
 (1) These helicopters were built for foreign military and are not eligible for an FAA Certificate of 
 Airworthiness (See NOTE 5)."
NOTE 16,"For Model 600N, a current Weight and Balance Report (MDHS’ Basic Weight and Balance Record) 
 listing the helicopter certificated empty (basic) weight and loading instructions including a List of 
 Equipment (MDHS’ MD-600N Required/Optional Equipment List is provided as a separate document) 
 must be provided for each helicopter at the time the helicopter’s original airworthiness certification is 
 issued. This Basic Weight and Balance Record shall be kept current as the configuration, affecting the 
 helicopter’s weight and balance, is changed. The MDHS Basic Weights Checklist Record (Chart A) and 
 Basic Weight Checklist Supplement for the Model 600N contains needed reference data for the Weight 
 and Balance Record. A copy of the current MDHS Basic Weight and Balance Record shall be kept in the 
 helicopter. The certificated basic weight and corresponding center of gravity locations includes all 
 transmission, hydraulic and engine oil/fluids as well as trapped/unusable fuel."
NOTE 17,"The model 600N rotorcraft employs electronic engine controls, commonly named Full Authority Digital 
 Engine Controls (FADEC) and is recognized to be more susceptible to Electromagnetic Interference 
 (EMI) than rotorcraft that have only manual (non-electronic) controls (EMI may be the result of radiated 
 or conducted interference.) For this reason modifications that add or change systems that have the 
 potential for EMI, must either be qualified to an FAA acceptable standard or tested at the time of 
 installation for interference to the FADEC. This type of testing must employ the particular FADEC’s 
 diagnostic techniques and external diagnostic techniques. The test procedure must be FAA approved."
NOTE 18,"Extension of the basic fuel capacity over 148.1 US gal. (Main Fuel Tank – 114.6 US Gal, plus Fuel Tank 
 - 33.5 US Gal) for the Model 600N may require reevaluation of the FADEC control system reliability 
 due to time limited exposure determinations made during certification."
NOTE 19,"The Model 600N is prohibited from flying in falling or blowing snow with the standard engine inlet 
 screen installed."
NOTE 20,"Any changes to the type design of this helicopter by means of an amended type certificate (TC), 
 supplemental type certificate (STC), or amended STC, requiring instructions for continued airworthiness 
 (ICA) must be submitted through the project aircraft certification office (ACO) for review and 
 acceptance by the Fort Worth -Aircraft Evaluation Group (FTW-AEG) Flight Standards District Office 
 (FSDO) prior to the aircraft delivery, or upon issuance of the first standard airworthiness certificate for 
 the affected aircraft, whichever occurs later as prescribed by Title 14 CFR § 21.50. Type design changes 
 (major repairs or alterations) by means of a FAA Form 337 (field approval) that require ICA’s must 
 have those ICA’s reviewed by the field approving FSDO."
