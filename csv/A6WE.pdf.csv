 Compliance has been found for the following regulations: 14 CFR § 26.11 (Amdt. No. 26-0), § 26.33 
 (Amdt. No 26-3), and § 26.43 and 26.45 (Amdt.No. 26-1). 
 The Special Conditions applying to the Model MD-90-30 are as follows: 
 (1) Special Conditions No. 25-95-WE-27 
 Airframe ""Hydraulic System Failure"" is applicable. 
 Powerplant ""In-Flight Thrust Reversal"" is applicable. 
 Flight Test ""Environmental Flight Testing"" is not required since FAR 25.253(a)(2)(iii) 
 Amendment 54 incorporates its intent. 
 (2) Special Condition, No. 25-88-WE-25, ""Automatic Takeoff Thrust Control System"" is not required 
 since ""Automatic Reserve Thrust Control System"" (ARTS) is deleted. 
 (3) Special Condition No. 25-ANM-26 ""Windshear"" is applicable. 
 (4) Special Condition No. 25-ANM-15 ""Lightning Protection for New Electronic Systems"" is 
 applicable. 
 A Special Condition on High Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF) (S.C. No. 25-ANM-60) is required as 
 indicated in Issue Paper G-4, Stage 3, Closed May 6, 1992. 
 Note: 
 For Model MD-90-30 equipped with Enhanced Flight Deck configuration, approved on 
 March 3, 1998, refer to additional certification basis. 
 Additional Certification Basis for Model MD-90-30 Equipped with Enhanced Flight Deck 
 Configuration: (Approved March 3, 1998) 
 The Saudi Arabian Airlines MD-90-30 configuration is equipped with six-across flight deck Liquid 
 Crystal Displays. For this configuration, an additional certification basis was established. 
 Based on the date of notification of major changes, April 5, 1996, in conjunction with the MD-90-30 
 certification basis, the certification basis for the Saudi Arabian Airlines MD-90-30 configuration is 
 Federal Aviation Regulations Part 25, effective February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 25-1 
 through 25-84. In addition, a new Special Condition concerning aircraft operations without normal 
 electrical power has been applied to the MD-90-30 model equipped with Enhanced Flight Deck 
 Configuration. For those areas and components for which, as part of the original MD-90-30 
 certification, exceptions were granted and are not impacted by the changes, no additional justification 
 is required. 
 Model MD-90-30 (cont’d) 
 There are four significant changes that constitute a substantial flight deck change and are required to be 
 certified to Federal Aviation Regulations Part 25 as amended by Amendments 25-1 through 25-84. 
 These changes relate to the incorporation of the new Electronic Display System which feature an 
 integrated flight deck display system with six-across Liquid Crystal Displays. These changes are: 
 • 
 Six Across Liquid Crystal Displays / Electronic Instrument System 
 • 
 Dual Pegasus Flight Management Computers 
 • 
 Improved Overhead Control Panel 
 • 
 Integrated Standby Instrument System 
 (Note: Takeoff Operation System / Host Performance Computer portion was canceled and is not 
 installed in the Saudi Arabian Airlines Enhanced Flight Deck Configuration.) 
 In addition, there are eight major changes that support the flight deck changes. These are for systems 
 and components where a fundamental design change was not made to the system but certain changes 
 were necessary for interfacing these systems and components to the new flight deck. These changes 
 do not constitute a substantial change and therefore compliance was substantiated to the certification 
 basis of the baseline MD-90-30.

 Brake Temperature Monitor System 
 • 
 Pneumatic System Controller Part Number Change 
 • 
 Fuel System Interface to Electronic Instrument System (EIS)

 (b) 
 The airplane must be loaded so that the C.G. is within specified limits at all times, considering 
 fuel loading and usage, gear retraction, and movement of crew and passengers from their 
 assigned positions. 
 (c) 
 The weight of system fuel and oil, as defined below, and hydraulic fluid, all of which must be 
 included in the airplane empty weight, is listed in the Master Weight and Balance Manual 
 specified in paragraph (a) above, for each airplane. 
 System Fuel: The weight of all fuel required to fill all lines and tanks up to the zero fuel 
 point on the fuel gages in the most critical flight attitude. This includes the unusable tank fuel 
 as defined by CAR 4b.416 (DC-9-11 thru -51) or FAR 25.959 (DC-9-81, -82, -83, -87, 
 MD-88 , MD-90-30 and 717-200). 
 System Oil: 
 The weight of oil remaining in the engine, constant speed drive and starter for 
 the DC-9 airplane (VSCF generator for MD-90-30 or IDG for 717-200), lines and tanks after 
 subtracting the oil in the tanks which is above the standpipe (zero gage) levels. The engine oil 
 tank capacities shown elsewhere in this data sheet include only the usable oil for which the 
 tanks must be placarded. 
 (d) 
 The ""unusable"" fuel is that amount of fuel, including tank trapped fuel, in the tanks which is 
 unavailable to the engines under critical flight conditions as defined in CAR 4b.416 (DC-9-11 
 thru -51) or FAR 25.959 (DC-9-81, -82, -83, -87, MD-88 , MD-90-30 and 717-200) and may 
 be obtained by taking the differences between the ""total"" and ""usable"" tank capacities shown 
 under ""fuel capacity."" This ""unusable"" fuel is included in system fuel as indicated in 1(c) 
 above and need not be accounted for separately. 
 (e) 
 All weight in excess of the maximum certificated zero fuel weight must be fuel in the main 
 tanks, except for Models DC-9-31, -32, -32F, -33F, -34, -34F, -41, -51, -81, -82, -83, -87, 
 MD-88, MD-90-30 and 717-200, (See Footnote (1) under Maximum Weights). Two fuel 
 pumps must be operating in each main tank unless extra reserve fuel is loaded to compensate 
 for an inoperative pump in accordance with the AFM. The center wing tank will supply fuel 
 to both engines directly. Fuselage tank pumps must be off for all take-offs and landings for 
 those airplanes which have fuselage tanks that supply the engines directly. The maximum 
 unbalance in fuel between the main tanks should not exceed 1,500 lb in flight."
