NOTE 1,"(a) Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated weight empty, and 
 loading instructions, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter 
 (except in the case of air carrier operators having an approved weight control system). Manufacturer’s 
 Master Equipment List contains list of approved equipment in addition to equipment listed in this specification. 
 (b) “System Fuel and Oil,” (See Item 103), which must be included in the empty weight, is that amount required 
 to fill both systems and the tanks up to the tank outlets to the engines, when the airplane is in the level attitude. 
 The propeller feathering oil in aircraft incorporating Hamilton Standard propellers is not considered usable oil 
 and is included in the “System Oil.” The nacelle oil tank capacities shown in this specification include only the 
 usable oil for which the tanks are to be placarded. All hydraulic system fluid must also be included in the 
 empty weight of the airplane. The weight of ADI fluid (20 gal. at 7.5 lbs/gal.) when item 111 is installed may, 
 if desired, be accounted for as usable weight the same as fuel and oil. 
 (c) For the interior arrangement of a particular airplane, see approved Douglas Report SM-12056 “Loading Chart 
 and Actual Weight and Balance.” This report shows the location of the passenger and crew member seats, 
 location and capacity of all cargo and baggage compartments, buffets and storage spaces, and location and 
 capacity of lounges and lavatories for each of the different sleeper and dayplane arrangements covered by the 
 above mentioned report. Lounges, lavatories, and baggage or cargo compartments must be placarded for the 
 capacities specified in the approved report. The airplane must always be loaded within the C.G. limits specified 
 in this specification, accounting for crew and passenger movement and use of fuel and oil. Retraction of the 
 landing gear changes the balancing moment by -193,800 in. pounds and moves the C.G. forward. Passenger 
 seats and safety belt installations other than originally provided by the manufacturer must be of an approved 
 type or shown to meet the strength requirements of CAR 4. 
 The following sleeper aircraft are satisfactory for only one person in each upper and in each lower berth: Serial 
 Nos. 42854 thru 42878, 42903, 42881, 43059, 43060, 43062 thru 43064 and 43105 thru 43118. The lower 
 berths may be modified for double occupancy as outlined in Douglas Service Bulletins DC-6 No. 120 and 
 DC-6 No. 188. When the modification has been accomplished, each lower berth should be placarded: “This 
 berth may be occupied by two persons.” All other sleeper aircraft not listed above, which incorporate lower 
 berths eligible for double occupancy will be placarded accordingly prior to delivery by the manufacturer. 
 (d) All fuel weight must be distributed equally on both sides of the airplane. All main tanks must be filled equally 
 first, then alternates, then auxiliaries (ten wing tank airplane). Fuel must be used in the reverse order from fuel 
 loading except for take-off , climb and landing at which time the main tanks must be used. 
 Satisfactory alternate fuel loading and fuel usage procedures have been approved and placed in the FAA 
 Approved Airplane Operating Manual. These alternate procedures may be used in lieu of the above. 
 (e) When dump valves are installed (See NOTE 3), the amount of usable fuel remaining in the fuel tanks after 
 dumping is as follows: 
 (1) Eight Wing Tank Airplane 
 Outer wing (#1 and #4 main) 
 113 gal. ea.

 The undumpable fuel and oil must be included in the landing weight. In some cases, the amount of 
 undumpable fuel and oil is greater than the difference between the maximum zero fuel and oil weight 
 and the maximum landing weight. When such is the case, the zero fuel and oil weight used in loading the 
 airplane must be reduced by an amount sufficient to insure that the maximum landing weight will not be 
 exceeded after fuel is dumped. 
 (f) When the oil transfer tank is installed in the wing fillet (on aircraft with a fuel capacity of 4722 gals. and 
 up), the weight of oil carried in this tank, plus the system oil (Item 103(j)) must be considered as 
 fuselage load and is to be included in the airplane zero fuel weight."
NOTE 2,"The following placards shall be placed on the instrument panel in full view of the pilot: 
 (a) “This airplane shall be operated in compliance with the operating limitations specified in FAA Approved 
 Airplane Operating Manual.”"
NOTE 3,"Fuel Dumping. Fuel dump valves (Item 102) must be installed for operation of the airplane at weights in 
 excess of the maximum landing weight as indicated in the Structural Limits Table of NOTE 6. Limitations 
 to be observed during the dumping of fuel are contained in the FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual. The 
 undumpable fuel for the various fuel tank capacities is covered in NOTE 1 (e) above."

NOTE 5,"A. Ham Std. 43D60/6825 propellers must be made nonreversible by setting the low pitch stop rings at the 
 minimum forward thrust pitch limit in addition to disconnecting the reversible controls. The following 
 airplanes, equipped with Ham. Std. 43D60/6825 or 43D60/6841 propellers were delivered with the 
 reversible feature inoperative: 42866 thru 42878; 43000 thru 43024; 43055 thru 43058; 43062 thru 43064 
 and 43103 thru 43110. The 43D60/6841 propellers on those aircraft listed above may be made 
 reversible by complying with the interim measures outlined in Douglas Service Bulletin DC-6 #124, or by 
 installing one each of the following Ham. Std. internal contactor parts per propeller: 
 No. 72513, “Spider Shim Plate”; No. 72507, “Reversing Signal Ring”; and No. 72539, “Connector.” 
 The propeller de-icer installation must also be reworked in accordance with Ham. Std. Dwg. Nos 72592 or 
 73367, “De-icer and Reversing Slip Ring Assembly.” All other airplanes equipped with Ham. Std. 
 43D60/6841 propellers or 43d60/6851 propellers which are suitable replacements for the 43D60/6841 
 propellers on CA series engines only, will incorporate the latest propeller reversing features prior to 
 delivery by the manufacturer. 
 B. On aircraft equipped with 43D60 propellers and R2800-83AM4 or CA series engines: 
 (1) The following placard must be installed in full view of the pilot: 
 “Avoid continuous operation above 2450 engine rpm for gross weight above 80,000 lbs. except for 
 take-off and emergencies.” 
 (2) In order to prevent hub barrel failures due to fatigue, the original series 43D60 hubs (having dash 
 numbers below 43) with Models 6841 and 6851 blades only used on ten wing tank type aircraft not 
 equipped with water injection engines shall be retired from service after a maximum of 500 take-offs 
 made with zero degree flaps at gross weights of 90,000 lbs. or more. However, if individual operators 
 cannot demonstrate to the FAA that they can maintain accurate count of individual take-offs made with 
 zero flap setting at weights in excess of 90,000 lbs. the hub barrels shall be retired after accumulating a 
 total of 3,000 hours in such operation. 
 C. On aircraft equipped with 43D60/6851-0 or 43D60/6873-0 propellers or a combination of these propellers 
 and any of the approved engines except R2800-83AM4 or the CA series: 
 (1) The following placards must be installed in full view of the pilot: 
 (a) “Maximum continuous engine operating speed for cruising, not more than 2200 rpm.” 
 (b) “Operation between 2200 rpm and 2450 rpm restricted.” 
 (c) “For gross weights above 80,000 lbs, use 2450 rpm for normal climb.” 
 (d) “Avoid continuous operation above 2450 rpm for gross weights above 80,000 lbs except for 
 take-off and emergencies.” 
 D. When water-alcohol injection is not used for take-off on aircraft equipped with the P & W Double Wasp 
 CB16 engines, Item 101(h), the propeller governors must be reset prior to take-off in order to limit the 
 take-off engine rpm to 2700."
NOTE 6,"The following table lists the maximum zero fuel and oil, landing and take-off weights of the various 8 and 10 wing 
 fuel tank aircraft as they are limited by structural strength. As indicated in the table by serial numbers, it is possible 
 to increase the zero fuel and oil weight, the landing weight and/or the take-off weight of certain of the aircraft, 
 provided the conditions as outlined in the pertinent footnotes are complied with. Although an aircraft may be 
 eligible, from a structural standpoint, for certain take-off weights, the take-off weight may be limited from a 
 performance standpoint due to the propeller and engine combination that is installed, the flap setting used and 
 whether water-alcohol injection is used to increase the take-off power. Therefore, the table of take-off weights 
 under maximum weights should also be adhered to in determining the maximum permissible take-off weight of 
 various aircraft.
