 (b) The airplane must be loaded so that the C.G. is within the specified limits at all 
 times, considering fuel and water loading and usage, gear retraction, ejector 
 extension, and movement of crew and passengers from their assigned positions. In 
 the case of the DC-8F, DC-8-61F, -62F, -63F, -71F, -72F and -73F, the lateral 
 loading limits contained in the pertinent weight and balance documents listed above 
 should not be exceeded. 
 (c) The weight of system fuel and oil, as defined below, and hydraulic fluid, all of 
 which must be included in the airplane empty weight, is listed in Douglas Master 
 Equipment List, Report No. SM-23454 (DC-8), LB-31064 (DC-8F), Chapter 2 of

 (DC-8-71/-71F), MDC-V0293 (DC-8-72/-72F), and MDC-V0294 (DC-8-73/73F). 
 System Fuel: 
 The weight of all fuel required to fill all lines and tanks up to the 
 zero fuel point of the fuel gages in the most critical flight attitude. 
 This includes the usable tank fuel as defined by CAR 4b.416. [The 
 DC-8-62, DC-8-62F, DC-8-63, DC-8-63F, DC-8-72, DC-8-72F, 
 DC-8-73, and DC-8-73F, have 121 lbs. (Based on 7.1 lbs./gal. fuel) 
 of usable fuel in the cross feed manifold that is not part of the 
 system fuel and must be included in the total usable fuel to obtain 
 correct weight and C.G. for takeoff. (See FAA Approved AFM for 
 approved procedures).] 
 NOTE: That part of the preceeding paragraph indicated in [ ] is 
 not applicable if the center fuel tank sump heater and 
 scavenge system is deactivated per Boeing Service 
 Bulletin DC8-28A089. 
 System Oil: 
 The weight of oil remaining in the engine, constant speed drive, 
 lines and tanks after subtracting the oil in the tanks which is above 
 the standpipe (zero gage) levels. The engine oil tank capacities 
 shown elsewhere in this data sheet include only the usable oil for 
 which the tanks must be placarded. 
 (d) The ""unusable"" fuel is that amount of fuel in the tanks which is unavailable to the 
 engines under critical flight conditions as defined in CAR 4b.416 and may be 
 obtained by taking the differences between the ""Total"" and ""Usable"" tank capacities 
 shown under ""Fuel Capacity."" This ""Unusable"" fuel is included in System Fuel as 
 indicated in 1(c) above and need not be accounted for separately. 
 (e) Fuel capacities shown in (g) below as well as fuel loading and usage procedures are 
 dictated by structural design and to maintain airplane C.G. within approved limits. 
 Fuel must be loaded symmetrically about airplane centerline and in accordance with 
 the following procedures and used as described below unless alternate procedures 
 are approved and incorporated in the FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual. The 
 fuel system contains automatic transfer and quantity control features which will 
 permit main tank-to-engine utilization of all fuel without manual control. The 
 performance of the automatic fuel system must be monitored during flight, however, 
 and if the automatic feature malfunctions, the tank quantities must be monitored 
 manually. During engine-out conditions, symmetrical fuel distribution must be 
 maintained by cross feed or transfer of fuel to the tanks being used. 
 8, 9, and 10 Tank Fuel Systems 
 (except 163,960 lb. and 172,234 lb., 8 Tank Fuel Systems) 
 Fuel Loading 
 (1) Fill the main tanks equally, until each main tank contains 7,000 lb. of fuel. 
 (2) Fill the inboard main tanks and the outboard alternate tanks equally until the 
 outboard alternate tanks are full. 
 (3) Fill the inboard main tanks and the outboard main tanks equally until the 
 inboard main tanks are full. 
 (4) Fill the inboard alternate tanks and the outboard main tanks in equal increment 
 until full. 
 NOTE: 
 A loading of 3500 lb. in each inboard alternate will assure priming of 
 the inboard alternate boost pumps. The quantities in the inboard 
 main tanks may be reduced during fuel loading to provide the 
 required total capacity. (Normal fuel loading should be restored after 
 engine start by use of the normal transfer system). 
 9 and 10 Tank Fuel System 
 (5) Fill the center wing auxiliary tank. 
 10 Tank Fuel System 
 (6) Fill the forward auxiliary tank. 
 NOTE: 
 The fuel loading specified should only be used to determine the 
 quantity of fuel to be contained in each tank upon the completion of 
 fueling. All tanks may be filled simultaneously and need only be 
 monitored during completion of fueling to assure that final fuel 
 quantities conform to the required fuel loading. 
 Fuel Management 
 Engines should normally be supplied from their corresponding main fuel tanks. 
 Except during takeoff, first the auxiliary tanks (if installed) an then the 
 alternate tanks should be used to maintain the main tanks at the required fuel 
 levels. The main tanks should be restored to the required fuel levels as soon as 
 possible after takeoff. 
 9 and 10 Tank Fuel Systems 
 (1) Any time fuel is contained in the center wing auxiliary tank, the fuel quantity 
 indicator selector for the inboard main tanks must be set 1,000 lbs. below the 
 fuel quantity indicator dial reading after the No. 2 and No. 3 main tanks have 
 been filled. This is done by first setting the indicator selection to 3,000 lbs. 
 below the indicator dial reading and then advancing the selector clockwise to 
 1,000 lbs. below the indicator dial reading. (Failure to follow this procedure 
 may result in some fuel spillage through the vents.) 
 10 Tank Fuel System 
 (2) (a) Use fuel from the main tanks while transferring fuel from the center wing 
 auxiliary tank and the forward auxiliary tank into the main tanks until the 
 auxiliary tanks are empty. (Forward auxiliary tank fuel may be used any time 
 prior to the completion of fuel usage from the center wing auxiliary tank.) 
 9 Tank Fuel System 
 (b) Use fuel from the main tanks while transferring fuel from the center wing 
 auxiliary tank into the main tanks until the auxiliary tank is empty. 
 NOTE: 
 When the center wing auxiliary tank fuel level reaches 2500 - 3100 
 lbs., fuel transfer into the outboard main tanks may be terminated (this will 
 assist in balancing the remaining fuel between the four engine fuel tank 
 systems), and the fuel quantity indicator selector for the inboard main tanks 
 may be moved past the full calibration on the indicator. 
 8, 9, and 10 Tank Fuel Systems 
 (3) Use fuel equally from the outboard main tanks and the inboard main tanks 
 while transferring fuel from the inboard alternate tanks into the inboard main 
 tanks until the inboard alternate tanks are empty. 
 NOTE: 
 When using fuel from the center wing auxiliary tank or the inboard 
 alternate tanks, regardless of density, do not exceed a fuel loading of 18,380 
 lbs. in the inboard main tanks. Due to variable attitude and fuel density, it may 
 be necessary to monitor the system or set the fuel quantity indicator selector to 
 assure tank quantities do not exceed 18,380 lbs. 
 (4) Use fuel equally from the inboard main tanks and the outboard main tanks until 
 each outboard main tank contains 7,000 lbs. of fuel. 
 NOTE: 
 With more than 7,500 lbs. of fuel in each of the outboard main tanks, 
 the outboard alternate tanks must be kept full. 
 (5) Use fuel equally from the inboard main tanks and the outboard main tanks 
 while transferring fuel from the outboard alternate tanks into the outboard main 
 tanks until the outboard alternate tanks are empty. 
 NOTE: 
 When using fuel from the outboard alternate tanks, regardless of 
 density, do not exceed a fuel loading of 7,500 lbs. in the outboard main tanks. 
 Due to variable attitude and fuel density, it may be necessary to monitor the 
 system or set the fuel quantity indicator selector to assure tank quantities do not 
 exceed 7,500 lbs. The quantity may be as low as 5,200 lbs. 
 (6) Use fuel equally from the inboard main tanks and the outboard main tanks. 
 NOTE: 
 Unbalance between fuel systems (Models DC-8F-54, DC-8-55 and 
 DC-8F-55) is permissible below 40,000 lbs. fuel load provided the unbalance 
 across the airplane centerline does not exceed 2,000 lbs. 
 163,960 lb. and 172,234 lb. 8 Tank Fuel Systems 
 Fuel Loading 
 NOTE: The fuel loading specified should only be used to determine the 
 quantity of fuel to be contained in each tank upon the completion of fueling. 
 All tanks may be filled simultaneously and need only be monitored during 
 completion of fueling to assure that final fuel quantities conform to the 
 required fuel loading. 
 (1) Fill the main tanks equally, until each tank contains 7,000 lbs. of fuel (3,000 
 for 172,234 lb. 8 Tank Fuel System). 
 (2) Fill the inboard main tanks and the outboard alternate tanks equally until the 
 outboard alternate tanks are full. 
 (3) Fill the inboard main tanks and the outboard main tanks equally until the 
 inboard main tanks are full. 
 (4) Fill the outboard main tanks until full. 
 (5) Fill the center wing auxiliary tank until full. 
 (6) Fill the forward auxiliary tank until full. 
 Fuel Management 
 Engines should normally be supplied from their corresponding main fuel tanks. 
 During takeoff, do not transfer fuel. At all other times, transfer fuel first from the 
 auxiliary tanks, then from the alternate tanks, to maintain the main tanks at the 
 required fuel levels to start of takeoff and as soon as possible after takeoff. 
 (1) Use fuel from the main tanks while transferring fuel from the center wing 
 auxiliary tank and the forward auxiliary tank into the main tanks until the 
 auxiliary tanks are empty. (Forward auxiliary tank fuel may be used any time 
 prior to the completion of fuel usage from the center wing auxiliary tank.) 
 NOTE: 
 (163,960 lb. 8 Tank Fuel System): When using fuel from the center 
 wing auxiliary tank, regardless of density, do not exceed a fuel 
 loading of 31,616 lbs. in the inboard tanks. Due to a variable attitude 
 and fuel density, it may be necessary to monitor the system or set the 
 fuel quantity indicator selector to assure tank quantities do not 
 exceed 31,616 lbs. 
 NOTE: 
 (172,234 lb. 8 Tank Fuel System): When the center wing auxiliary 
 tank fuel level reaches 1500 - 2100 lb., fuel transfer into the outboard 
 main tanks may be terminated, thus balancing the remaining fuel 
 between the four engine fuel tank systems. 
 (2) Use fuel equally from the inboard main tanks and the outboard main tanks until 
 each outboard main tank contains 7,000 lbs. of fuel (3000 for 172,234 lb. 8 
 Tank Fuel System). 
 NOTE: 
 (163,960 lb. 8 Tank Fuel System): With more than 7500 lbs. of fuel 
 in each of the outboard main tanks, the outboard alternate tanks must 
 be kept full. 
 NOTE: 
 (172,234 lb. 8 Tank Fuel System). Any time there is more than 5000 
 lbs. of fuel in each of the outboard main tanks, the outboard alternate 
 tanks must be kept full. Any time the total fuel load is more than 
 32,700 lbs. the outboard alternate tanks must be properly controlled 
 to prevent the alternate low level lights from flashing. 
 (3) Use fuel equally from the inboard main tanks and the outboard main tanks 
 while transferring fuel from the outboard alternate tanks into the outboard main 
 tanks until the outboard alternate tanks are empty. 
 NOTE: 
 (163,960 lb. 8 Tank Fuel System): When using fuel from the 
 outboard alternate tanks, regardless of density, do not exceed a fuel 
 loading of 7,500 lbs. in the outboard main tanks. Due to variable 
 attitude and fuel density, it may be necessary to monitor the system 
 or set the fuel quantity indicator selector to assure tank quantities do 
 not exceed 7,500 lbs. 
 NOTE: 
 (172,234 lb. 8 Tank Fuel System): During this usage, the fuel 
 quantity in No. 1 and No. 4 main tanks will normally be maintained 
 at 2,600 to 3,600 lbs. by the intermediate level control. Due to 
 variable attitude and fuel density, this will vary; therefore, the system 
 must be monitored to assure that the quantity does not exceed 5,000 
 lbs., nor is it desirable that it be permitted to fall below 2,500 lbs. 
 (4) Use fuel equally from the inboard main tanks and the outboard main tanks. 
 NOTE: 
 Unbalance between fuel systems is permissible below 40,000 lbs. 
 fuel load provided: 
 (1) Unbalance across the airplane centerline does not exceed 2,000 
 lbs. 
 (2) Limitations noted for minimum fuel in outboard alternate tanks 
 are observed. 
 (3) Inboard system does not exceed outboard system by more than 
 2,000 lbs. 
 (f) Fuel Dump. Fuel dump valves must be installed for operation of the airplane in 
 excess of the maximum landing weight. Refer to FAA Approved Airplane Flight 
 Manual for limitations to be observed during fuel dumping. The total undumpable 
 fuel must be included in the landing weight and the amount of usable fuel remaining 
 in the fuel tanks after dumping is as follows:

 locking pins in relation to the center line of the overwing emergency exits for each 
 of the approved seat models called out on the interior arrangement. Douglas DC-8 
 Service Bulletin No. 52-21 outlines modifications required to Douglas manufactured 
 seats located adjacent to the required exits. Douglas Drawing 5777041, ""FAA 
 Approved DC-8F Type I Emergency Exit Seat Clearance,"" prescribes minimum 
 dimensions for locating seats at the Type I exits at Station 1164 on the Model DC- 
 8F-54 and DC-8F-55. 
 (b) When the aft overwing exists are not required (see table below), they may be 
 completely or partially blocked. If completely blocked (do not comply with (a) 
 above, all identification as an exit must be removed from both the inside and the 
 outside. They may be partially blocked by moving the seats adjacent to the forward 
 side of the exit to the rear so that the seat protrudes into the exit opening with the 
 seat back in the normal upright position. The 17-1/16 inch dimension from the exit 
 center line to the rear seat leg locking pin, which is shown on Douglas Dwg. 
 5769196, may be reduced by a maximum of four inches when Double Deluxe seats 
 are installed or by a maximum of five inches when tourist seats are installed. When
