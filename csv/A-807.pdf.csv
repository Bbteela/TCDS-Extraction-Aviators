 by this certificate has been examined and found to comply with British Civil 
 Airworthiness Requirements published Jan. 1947 and with the special requirements 
 notified by the U.S. Government to the Government of the United Kingdom."" 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness 
 (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification

 • 
 The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures of the FAA 
 approved manuals. 
 The FAA uses post type validation procedures to approve these documents. The FAA 
 may delegate case-by-case approval to the UK CAA on behalf of the FAA for the U.S.
