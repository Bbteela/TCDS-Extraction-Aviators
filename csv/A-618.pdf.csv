 conditions as set forth in Items (a) and (c) of NOTE 9 are complied with. For airplanes of United States 
 registry, this applies only to airplanes operated by certificated air carriers. The following airspeed limits are 
 applicable for weights between 25,200 and 26,200 lbs.: 
 Level flight or climb 
 205 mph (178 knots) True Ind. 
 Glide or dive 
 251 mph (218 knots) True Ind. 
 Flaps extended 
 112 mph ( 97 knots) True Ind. 
 See NOTE 10 for partial flap speeds. 
 An FAA Approved Flight Manual will be required for airplanes of United States registry operating at these 
 weights."
NOTE 12,"The following is applicable to airplanes certificated under the provisions of CAB Special Regulation SR-407: 
 Model DC3 aircraft have been determined to meet the structural requirements of CAR 1a as amended April 7, 
 1950, for a maximum landing and take-off weight of 26,900 lbs. and may be certificated for passenger carrying 
 at weights up to and including 26,900 lbs., when Wright R 1820 series or P&W R 1830 series engines are 
 installed whose Maximum Continuous hp does not exceed 1100 and whose Take off hp does not exceed 1350, 
 provided that the total weight of the engine-propeller installation forward of the firewall does not exceed 2500 
 lbs. and the following are accomplished: 
 (a) The structural modifications and installation of tires and wheels in accordance with NOTE 9 are required 
 if the landing weight exceeds 25,200 lbs. or the take-off weight exceeds 26,200 lbs. 
 10827, 10828 and 10829 and Douglas Dwg. #5162328 on the following aircraft: All serial numbers up to 
 and including 1976, 1979 through 2003, 2009, 2011 through 2016, and 2019 through 2028. 
 (c) Wright R-1820 series engines having a Maximum Continuous hp not to exceed 1100 and a Take-off hp 
 not to exceed 1350 are installed. Engines incorporating two speed super chargers must be locked in low 
 blower unless satisfactory cooling tests are conducted and any modifications found necessary to permit 
 high blower operation are incorporated. 
 (d) Any increase in power above .200 hp must not adversely affect the flight characteristics of the airplane. It 
 has been determined that the directional controllability and stability of the DC-3 series aircraft is 
 inadequate in the one- engine out condition if engines having more than 1200 hp for take-off are installed. 
 Therefore, suitable modifications must be made to the airplane in a manner acceptable to the 
 Administrator, which will maintain flight characteristics equivalent to those previously approved. One 
 such modification which has been approved for a maximum of 1350 hp for take-off is a geared rudder tab 
 installation which is described on Item 602. 
 (e) An FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual is required and must be carried in the airplane at all times. For 
 airplanes using a maximum of 1200 hp for take-off a maximum weight of 26,200 lbs. has been established 
 and may be approved without further tests. For airplanes using over 1200 hp up to 1350 hp for takeoff, if 
 it is desired to increase the maximum weight above 26,200 lbs. to a maximum of 26,900 lbs., performance 
 substantiation is required. 
 (f) The following airspeed (TIAS) limits are applicable: 
 Up to and including 
 Between 24,800 lbs. 
 Between 25,200 lbs. 
 24,800 lbs. 
 and 25,200 lbs. 
 and 26,900 lbs. 
 Vl (level flight or climb) 
 201 mph (175 knots) 
 195 mph (170 knots) 
 183 mph (159 knots) 
 Vne (never exceed) 
 241 mph (210 knots) 
 233 mph (202 knots) 
 219 mph (190 knots) 
 Vf (Flaps 1/4) 
 155 mph (135 knots) 
 155 mph (135 knots) 
 155 mph (135 knots) 
 (Flaps 1/2) 
 114 mph ( 99 knots) 
 114 mph ( 99 knots) 
 114 mph ( 99 knots) 
 (Flaps 3/4) 
 112 mph ( 97 knots) 
 112 mph ( 97 knots) 
 112 mph ( 97 knots) 
 (Flaps full) (45°) 
 112 mph ( 97 knots) 
 112 mph ( 97 knots) 
 112 mph ( 97 knots) 
 (g) The DC-3 series aircraft is not structurally satisfactory for take-off weight in excess of 26,900 lbs. 
 Therefore, if the takeoff weight, up to a maximum of 26,900 lbs., does not exceed the landing weight by 
 more than 105%, dump valves are not required. No allowance for de-icer installation will be permitted at 
 any weight. If an automatic pilot is installed in the airplane, satisfactory flight tests must be completed to 
 determine the effects upon the automatic pilot servo forces of any modification made to the airplane to 
 maintain its flight characteristics. The forces shown in items 402(b) and (d) of this specification for the 
 Sperry A-12 and Pioneer PB-10 automatic pilots have been demonstrated to be satisfactory when the 
 ""Geared Rudder Tab"" (Item 602) is installed provided the maximum speed for operation of the automatic 
 pilot is limited to 180 mph. 
 (h) In lieu of installing the Wright R-1820 series engines, the P&W R-1830 series engines may be installed in 
 accordance with Aircraft Specification A-669 including NOTE 13 of that specification. Since the Wright 
 engine powered DC-3 aircraft covered by this specification incorporated engine mounts supported at five 
 points on the firewall, while the P&W engine powered DC-3A as covered by Specification A-669 
 incorporated engine mounts supported at four points on the firewall, the following must be accomplished 
 when installing the P&W R-1830 series engines on aircraft originally incorporating the Wright R-1820 
 series engines: 
 (1) If it is desired to retain or install the forged mount per Douglas Dwg. No. 5110599, suitable 
 modifications must be made to the nacelle and firewall to withstand the loads imposed by the 
 four-point suspension, or 
 (2) Install a new engine mount, supported at five points on the firewall, which is structurally adequate to 
 withstand the loads resulting from the increased hp and weight of the power plant installation. 
 P&W R-2000-7M2 or -D5 engines may be installed in lieu of the R-1820 Series engines provided the 
 above items are complied with and the installation is made in accordance with Item 101(d) of Aircraft 
 Specification A-669. 
 (a) DST-G102, DST G102A and DTS-G202A, serial numbers 1494 and up. 
 (b) DC3B-G102 and DC3B-G202A, serial nubmers 1922 and up."
