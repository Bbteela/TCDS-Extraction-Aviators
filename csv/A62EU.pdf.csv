 certificate Number 2065. The FAA validated this product under U.S. Type 
 Certificate Number A62EU. Effective September 28, 2003, the European 
 Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this product on behalf of 
 Germany."
Import Requirements,"This aircraft is not eligible for operations in the United States. Please contact 
 the FAA, Small Airplane Directorate at Kansas City, Missouri for additional 
 information."
Equipment,"Basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (see ""Certification Basis"") must be installed in the aircraft for 
 certification."
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the 
 European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before 
 September 28, 2003 – by the Luftfahrt Bundesamt. 
 • Service bulletins, 
 • Structural repair manuals, 
 • Vendor manuals, 
 • Aircraft flight manuals, and 
 • Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved unless 
 one of the following conditions exists: 
 • The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures of the 
 FAA approved manuals; or 
 •The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this product’s 
 U.S. type certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. 
 The FAA may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to approve on behalf of the 
 FAA for the U.S. type certificate. If this is the case it will be noted on the 
 document."
NOTE 1,"Weight and Balance 
 Current weight and balance data together with a list of equipment included in 
 the certificated empty weight, and loading instructions, must be provided for 
 each aircraft at the time of original certification."
NOTE 2,"Placards 
 All placards listed in the approved Airplane Flight Manual must be installed in 
 the appropriate locations. Each airplane has to be supplied with a placard that 
 specifies the kind of operations to which the operation of the individual 
 airplane is limited by its installed equipment. 
 The following placard must be displayed on the instrument panel in full view of 
 the pilot: 
 ""OPERATIONAL LIMITS 
 The marking and placards installed in this airplane contain operating 
 limitations which must be complied with when operating this airplane in the 
 commuter category. Other limitations which must be compiled with when 
 operating this airplane in this category are contained in the:

 Flight under known icing conditions is prohibited."
NOTE 5,"Life Limits. 
 Service Life Limited components airframe: 30,000 flight hours. 
 Every 3,600 flight hours the ""Significant Structural Items Inspection"" and 
 prior to 30,000 flight hours the ""Airframe Major Inspection"" must be 
 performed. This may provide the necessary clearance for further flight."
NOTE 6,"Painting 
 White is the only permitted color for the aircraft frame. Changing the color 
 and the thickness of the coat is only permissible after prior approval by the
