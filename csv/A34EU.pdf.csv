 For those aircraft imported from the country of manufacture the Swiss Federal Office of 
 Civil Aviation Certificate of Airworthiness for Export endorsed as noted below under 
 ""Import Requirements"" must be submitted for each individual aircraft for which 
 application for airworthiness certification is made."
Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export 
 Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the 
 Luftfahrt Bundesamt on behalf of the European Community. The Export C of A should 
 contain the following statement: “The aircraft covered by this certificate has been 
 examined, tested, and found to comply with U.S. airworthiness regulations 14 CFR Part 
 23 approved under U.S. Type Certificate No. A34EU and to be in a condition for safe 
 operation.” 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the 
 United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to 
 identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of 
 airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions 
 to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, 
 Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an 
 airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft. 
 Prior to May 8, 2015: 
 A Standard Airworthiness Certificate may be issued on the basis of a Certificate 
 of Airworthiness for Export signed by a representative of the Swiss Federal 
 Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) containing the following statement: ""The 
 airplane covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to 
 conform to the type design approved under the FAA Type Certificate A34EU 
 and is in a condition for safe operation."" 
 Model AS 202/18A4 Aircraft imported in the USA must be equipped in 
 accordance with modification kit no. 30 (containing AFM Report No. FV-877 
 and the appropriate placards), and meet the identification and marking 
 requirements of FAR 45. 
 As of November 5, 2009, the requirements of EASA Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2009- 
 0233 dated October 28, 2009 must be accomplished before the airplane is eligible for its 
 initial US airworthiness certificate. This will include the initial inspection and the 
 incorporation of the repetitive inspection requirements of the EASA AD into the 
 airplane’s airworthiness limitation section. (See NOTE 3)"
Model AS 20215,"FAR 23 dated February 1, 1965, as amended through Amendment 23-13 
 effective October 23, 1972. Type Certificate No. A34EU issued November 16, 1973."
Model AS 20218A,"FAR 23 dated February 1, 1965, as amended through Amendment 23-14 
 effective December 20, 1973. Type Certificate No. A34EU amended December 17, 
 1976."
Model AS 20218A4,"FAR 23 dated February 1, 1965, as amended through Amendment 23-14 
 effective December 20, 1973; FAR 23.2, 23.561(b)(2) as amended through 
 Amendment 23-36 effective September 14, 1988; FAR 36 effective on date 
 of amended type certificate issuance. Type Certificate No. A34EU amended 
 February 4, 1993. 
 The EASA type certificate for the AS 202 series models is EASA.A.591."
Validation Basis,"Type Certificate A34EU was issued pursuant to FAR 21.29(a) in validation of 
 a Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) certification of compliance with 
 the afore-mentioned Certification Basis (see above)."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the airplane for 
 standard airworthiness certification. 
 In addition, the following items of equipment are required: 
 1. 
 Aural Stall Warning System 
 2. 
 Model AS 202/15 ""BRAVO"" - FOCA approved Airplane Flight Manual, 
 Ref. FFA Report No. FV-862 dated December 1972 or later FOCA 
 approved revision; Model AS 202/18A ""BRAVO"" - FOCA approved 
 Airplane Flight Manual, Ref. FFA Report No. FV-866 dated October 1976 
 or later FOCA-approved revision; Model AS 202/18A4 ""BRAVO"" - 
 FOCA approved Airplane Flight Manual, Ref. FFA Report No. FV-877 
 dated January 1993 or later FOCA approved revision."
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the 
 European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or - for approvals made before 
 May 8, 2015 - by FOCA. 
 • Service bulletins. 
 • Structural repair manuals. 
 • Vendor manuals. 
 • Aircraft flight manuals, and 
 • Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved unless one 
 of the following conditions exists: 
 • The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures of the 
 FAA approved manuals: or 
 • The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this product's 
 U.S. type certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. 
 The FAA may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to approve on behalf of the 
 FAA for the U.S. type certificate. If this is the case it will be noted on the 
 document."
Note 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment in certificated empty weight, and loading 
 instructions when necessary, must be provided for each airplane at the time of original airworthiness 
 certification. The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of gravity must include 
 undrainable oil of 0 lb. at (-23.25) and unusable fuel of 15.6 lb. at (+32.75) for Models AS 202/15 
 and 18A, 21.8 lb. at (+32.95) for Model AS 202/18A4. All center of gravity (c.g.) positions are given 
 in inches from datum."
Note 2,"The following placard must be displayed in clear view of the pilot: 
 ""This airplane must be operated as a Normal, Utility, or Acrobatic Category airplane in compliance with 
 the operating limitations stated in the form of placards, markings, and manuals."" In addition, all 
 placards required in the approved Airplane Flight Manual must be installed in the appropriate locations. 
 Each individual airplane will be supplied with a placard that specifies the kinds of operation such as 
 VCR, or IFR, DAY or NIGHT, to which the operation of the airplane is limited by the equipment installed."
