Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (See Certification basis) must be installed in the helicopter for 
 certification. In addition, the following items of equipment are required with 
 each helicopter as specified: 
 FAA approved Helicopter Flight Manual 
 (1) Model 214B dated January 27, 1976 
 (2) Model 214B-1 dated February 2, 1976"
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in the certificated empty weight 
 and loading instructions when necessary must be provided for each helicopter at the time of original 
 certification. 
 The certificated empty weight and corresponding C.G. locations must include a total undrainable oil of 
 9.2 lb. (+195.0) and unusable fuel of 25.2 lb. (+140.0)."
NOTE 2,"The following placard must be displayed in front of and in clear view of the pilot: “This Helicopter 
 must be operated in compliance with the operating limitations specified in the FAA Approved 
 Rotorcraft Flight Manual. The Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Rotorcraft Maintenance 
 Manual must be complied with.” 
 All placards required in the Approved Helicopter Flight Manual must be installed in the appropriate 
 locations. Chapter 11 of the Maintenance Manual includes information about other placards and their 
 locations."
NOTE 3,"The retirement times of certain parts and inspection requirements are listed in Airworthiness 
 limitations, Chapter 4, of the Model 214B/B-1 series Maintenance Manual. These limitations may not 
 be changed without FAA engineering approval. In addition, information essential for proper 
 maintenance of the helicopter is contained in the Bell Helicopter Company Model 214B/B-1 
 Maintenance Manual and in the 214B/B-1 series Component Repair and Overhaul Manual."
NOTE 4,"Model 214B/B-1 helicopters equipped with the external cargo suspension installation completed in 
 accordance with Bell Drawing 214-706-002 meet the structural and design requirements of the 
 certification basis when operated to 16,000 pounds gross weight in accordance with the limits of FAA 
 Approved Model 214B Helicopter Flight Manual dated January 27, 1976, and Model 214B-1 Manual 
 dated February 2, 1976. The retirement times referenced in Note 3 are not changed. Gross weights

 installed that obstruct the view of the crew/passenger front doors latch engagement with the fuselage."
NOTE 6,"VHF navigation installations are limited to Collins Radio Type VIR31H, P/N 622-2819-004 due to 
 rotor modulation interference. Other VHF navigation installations must be coordinated through FAA, 
 Southwest Region, Engineering and Manufacturing Branch, ASW-210."
NOTE 7,"Engine gas producer speed shown under “engine limits” is the absolute maximum permissible rotation 
 speed. Equal or lower speeds are established for each engine during engine calibration and are 
 stamped on the engine data plate. Maximum usable (limiting) gas producer speeds for takeoff and for 
 maximum continuous power vary with ambient temperature and are shown on the engine limitations 
 placard on the instrument panel. This placard includes information on engine data plate speeds which 
 must agree with the actual engine installed in the helicopter."
NOTE 8,"Maximum usable (limiting) exhaust gas temperature for takeoff and maximum continuous engine 
 operation varies with ambient temperature and is shown on the placard described in Note 7 above."
NOTE 9,"For all operations below 40F ambient temperature, all fuel used in Model 214B helicopters must 
 contain Phillips PFA-55MB anti-icing additive in concentrations of not less than 0.035% nor more than 
 0.15% by volume. Blending this additive into the fuel and checking its concentration must be 
 conducted in the manner prescribed by the Rotorcraft Flight Manual."
NOTE 10,"Except for a difference in maximum weight, the Model 214B and 214B-1 are identical to each other."
NOTE 11,"Composite (fiberglass) main rotor blades (215-015-500 or 214-018-402) must have conductive paint (a 
 minimum resistance required) for lightning protection."
NOTE 12,"Any changes to the type design of this helicopter by means of amended type certificate (TC), 
 supplemental type certificate (STC), or amended STC, requiring instructions for continued 
 airworthiness (ICA’s) must be submitted thru the project aircraft certification office (ACO) for review 
 and acceptance by the Fort Worth-Aircraft Evaluation Group (FTW-AEG) Flight Standards district 
 Office (FSDO) prior to the aircraft delivery, or upon issuance of the first standard airworthiness 
 certificate for the affected aircraft, whichever occurs later as prescribed by Title 14 CFR 21.50. Type 
 design changes by means of a FAA Form 337 (field approval) that require ICA’s must have those 
 ICA’s reviewed by the field approving FSDO."
