1,"For propeller speed below 1,600 RPM the torque is limited to 1,100 lb ft."
2,"Normal oil pressure with gas generator speed above 72 %. At normal oil temperature between 60 to 
 70º C and torque below 2,000 lb ft the minimum oil pressure is 60 psi. Oil pressures under 90 psi are 
 undesirable. Under emergency conditions, to complete a flight, a lower oil pressure limit of 60 psi is 
 permissible at reduced power level not exceeding 1,100 lb ft torque. If oil pressure drops below 60 
 psi, shutdown the engine or make a precautionary landing using minimum power required to sustain 
 flight. During an extremely cold weather start, oil pressure may reach 200 psi."
3,"switched on (ECS ON) and the outside air temperature influence combined, the low and high idle 
 speeds may be lower by 3 %."

 Special Conditions: High Intensity Radiated Fields, (HIRF), Number 
 23-137-SC, issued September 16, 2003. 
 Date of Application for U.S. Type Certificate June 8, 1998. 
 The Civil Aviation Authority of the Czech Republic (CAA-CZ) 
 originally type certificated this aircraft on behalf of EASA without 
 issuing its own Czech Republic type certificate. The FAA validated this 
 product under U.S. Type Certificate Number A58CE. Effective 
 December 12, 2005, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) 
 began oversight of this product on behalf of the Czech Republic. The 
 EASA TCDS number is EASA.A.060."
Validation Basis,"The applicable airworthiness requirements for a U.S. certification under 
 14 CFR 21 section 21.29 identified above were established considering 
 the airworthiness requirements applied by the responsible exporting 
 Czech-Republic civil aviation authority under the Bilaterial Aviation 
 Agreement (BAA) authorized by the Agreement between the 
 Government of the Czech-Republic and the Government of the United 
 States of America, including the Operating Procedure and the interim 
 working agreement between the Government of the United States of 
 America and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) per FAA 
 Order 8110.52. 
 This Type Certificate was issued pursuant to the certification by the 
 CAA-CZ and EASA that the Aero Vodochody Model Ae 270 complies 
 with the above requirements. 
 EASA issued EASAType Certificate No. A.060, as described in EASA 
 TCDS No. EASA.A.060 Issue 001."
Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA 
 Export Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a 
 representative of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Czech Republic 
 (CAA-CZ) on behalf of the European Community. The Export C of A 
 should contain the following statement: ‘The aircraft covered by this 
 certificate has been examined, tested, and found to comply with U.S. 
 airworthiness regulations 14 CFR Federal Aviation Regulations Part 
 23, U.S. Type Certificate No. A58CE and to be in a condition for safe 
 operation.’ 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for 
 import into the United States of both new and used aircraft based on the 
 scope of the agreement, to identify any required statements by the 
 exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness (or 
 equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions 
 to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 
 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements for 
 issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft. 
 Model Ae 270 airplane with serial numbers 0006 and subsequent are 
 eligible for a U.S. Standard Airworthiness Certificate."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable 
 airworthiness regulations (see Certification Basis) must be installed in 
 the airplane for certification. Such equipment is listed in the current 
 FAA approved Airplane Flight Manual, BPOH01EN, (Revision 2, 
 dated October 6, 2006) or later approved revisions."
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the 
 European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made 
 before December 12, 2005 – by the Civil Aviation Authority of the 
 Czech Republic (CAA-CZ). 
 • Service bulletins, 
 • Structural repair manuals, 
 • Vendor manuals, 
 • Aircraft flight manuals, and 
 • Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved 
 for type design data only unless one of the following conditions exists: 
 • The documents change the limitations, performance, or 
 procedures of the FAA approved manuals; or 
 •The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this 
 product’s U.S. type certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these 
 documents. The FAA may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to 
 approve on behalf of the FAA for the U.S. type certificate. If this is the 
 case it will be noted on the document. 
 Each airplane is provided with the following approved documents: 
 a) Aero Vodochody Ae 270 Airplane Flight Manual, Ref. No.: 
 BPOH01EN, (Revision 2, dated October 6, 2006) or later FAA 
 approved revision. 
 b) Aero Vodochody Ae 270 Airplane Maintenance Manual, Ref. No.: 
 BMAI01EN, Rev. 1, dated October 20, 2006 or later FAA approved 
 revision, including: 
 Chap. 4: ""Airworthiness Limitations"" and Chap. 5: ""Time 
 Limits/ Maintenance Check"". 
 c) Aero Vodochody Ae 270 Airplane Wiring Manual, Ref. No.: 
 BWIR02EN, Rev. 1, dated October 20, 2006 or later FAA approved 
 revisions."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance data including list of equipment included in 
 the certificated empty weight and loading instructions, when necessary, 
 must be provided for each airplane at the time of original certification, 
 and remain with the airplane at all times thereafter. The certificated 
 empty weight and corresponding center of gravity locations must 
 include the following: 
 Unusable fuel of 12.4 US gal (82.8 lbs.) {47.0 l; 37.5 kg}"
NOTE 2,"Airplane operation must be in accordance with the EASA approved 
 Airplane Flight Manual listed above. All placards listed in Section 2 
 must be displayed in clear view of the pilot."
NOTE 3,"Airworthiness Limitations are specified in the Section 2 
 LIMITATIONS chapter of the Flight Manual and Chapter 4 of the 
 Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (Maintenance Manual) and 
 are approved by EASA and the FAA. These LIMITATIONS specify 
 mandatory replacement times, and operating limitations, and may not be 
 changed without EASA and FAA approval. 
 The FAA must approve revisions to the Airworthiness Limitations. The 
 inspections, maintenance, repair and painting must be accomplished 
 according to the Maintenance Manual or other procedures acceptable to 
 the FAA."
NOTE 4,"Information essential for the proper operation, maintenance and 
 inspection of the airplane is contained in the Aero Vodochody Ae 270 
 Airplane Flight Manual and Maintenance Manual."
NOTE 5,"All avionics installed in this aircraft must meet the applicable FAA 
 Technical Standard Order (TSO) and/or equivalent FAA approved
