Certification Basis,"CAR 10. CAR 3 dated May 15, 1956 including amendments 3-1 through 3-5. Type 
 Certificate No. 7A15, issued November 9, 1961. 
 Date of Application for Type Certificate: October 11, 1960. 
 The Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) originally type certificated this 
 aircraft under its type certificate Number F-56-10. The FAA validated this product under 
 U.S. Type Certificate Number 7A15. Effective December 1, 2006, the European Aviation 
 Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this product on behalf of Switzerland. The 
 EASA TCDS No. has not been issued at this time. 
 The Swiss Federal Air Office ""Certificate of Airworthiness for Export"" endorsed as noted 
 below under ""Import Requirements"" must be submitted for each individual aircraft for 
 which application for certification is made. (See NOTE 4)."
Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export Certificate 
 of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the Swiss Federal Office 
 of Civil Aviation (FOCA) on behalf of the European Community. The Export C of A 
 should contain the following statement: ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been 
 examined, tested, and found to comply with U.S. Civil Air Regulation Part 3 U.S. Type 
 Certificate No. 7A15 and to be in a condition for safe operation.’ 
 Model PC-6 and PC-6/350 series: ""The airplane covered by this certificate has been 
 examined and found to comply with U.S. Civil Air Regulations 
 Part 3, dated May 15, 1956 including Amendment 3-1 through 3-5 and conforms to T.C. 
 7A15"". 
 Model PC-6/A series: ""The airplane covered by this certificate has been examined and 
 found to comply with U.S. Civil Air Regulation Part 3, dated May 15, 1956 including 
 Amendment 3-1 through 3-5 and Special Conditions notified by FAA, letter dated 
 November 14, 1962 to the Swiss Federal Air Office, and conforms to T.C. 7A15"". 
 Models PC-6/B, /B1, /B2, /C, and /C1 series: ""The airplane covered by this certificate 
 has been examined and found to comply with U.S. Civil Air Regulation Part 3, dated 
 May 15, 1956 including Amendments 3-1 through 3-5 and Special Conditions notified by 
 FAA, letter dated January 4, 1967 and conforms to T.C. 7A15"". 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness 
 (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification 
 of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported 
 aircraft."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. In addition, the 
 following items of equipment are required: 
 (a) Swiss Federal Air Office approved Airplane Flight Manual (as limited below) 
 (b) Stall warning indicator, Safe Flight 1-02-0005, or 164 
 (c) Ratier Figeac Spinner FH 76-400 (PC-6/A series only) 
 (d) Clogged fuel filter warning light (PC-6/A, /B, /B1, /B2, /C, and /C1 series only). 
 (e) Stabilizer dual motor trim actuator Electro Mech EM 483 
 Mandatory for PC-6/B2-H4 only."
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the European Aviation 
 Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before December 1, 2006 – Swiss Federal 
 Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA). 
 • Service bulletins, 
 • Structural repair manuals, 
 • Vendor manuals, 
 • Aircraft flight manuals, and 
 • Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved for type design data 
 only unless one of the following conditions exists: 
 • The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures of the FAA approved 
 manuals; or 
 •The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this product’s U.S. type 
 certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. The FAA 
 may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to approve on behalf of the FAA for the U.S. type 
 certificate. If this is the case it will be noted on the document."
