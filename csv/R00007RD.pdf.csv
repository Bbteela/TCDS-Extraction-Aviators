 Airworthiness for Export or certifying statement endorsed by the exporting foreign 
 civil airworthiness authority which states the following (in the Englishlanguage): 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the 
 United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, 
 to identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the export 
 certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures for 
 coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to 
 FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements for 
 issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft. 
 “The rotorcraft covered by this certificate has been examined, 
 tested and found to conform to the type design approved under 
 FAA Type Certificate No. R00007RD and to be in condition for 
 safe operation.” 
 The only aircraft eligible for import into the United States are those 
 aircraft with the configuration defined in AW Report No. 
 169F0272N003, “AW169 - FAA Type Design Definition,” dated 
 23 January 2017 or latest issue.."

Equipment,"As per compliance with certification basis and included in Type 
 Design Definition standard. 
 Refer to approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual and MMEL 
 Refer to EASA Approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual and related 
 supplements for other approved mandatory and optional 
 equipment. 
 Night Vision Goggle Operations are permitted according to RFM 
 169F0290X001 Supplement No. 16. The aircraft configuration 
 involving internal/external emitting/reflecting equipment approved 
 for use with NVG is described in the Report N. 169F3360A001 
 «AW169 NVG Compatibility Reference Handbook». Subsequent 
 modifications and deviations to the NVG helicopter configuration 
 shall be managed in accordance with document 169F3360E001 « 
 AW169 Helicopter NVG Policy »"
Service information,"Lenonardo S.p.a. service bulletins, structural repair manuals, 
 vendor manuals, aircraft flight manuals, and overhaul and 
 maintenance manuals, which contain a statement that the document 
 is EASA approved, are accepted by the FAA and are considered 
 FAA approved. These approvals pertain to the approved type 
 design only."
Flight Manual,"EASA approved on behalf of FAA Rotorcraft Flight Manual, 
 169F0290X001, Issue 1 Revision 3 or later approved revision (See 
 NOTE 5)."
Maintenance Manual,"Maintenance Planning Information 69-A-AMPI-00-P 
 Maintenance Publication 69-A-AMP-00-X."
NOTE 1,"A current weight and balance report, including a list of equipment included in the certificated empty weight, must be 
 provided for each helicopter at the time of original airworthiness certification in accordance with 14 CFR 29.25, 29.27 
 and 29.29."
NOTE 2,"All placards required by either FAA Approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual, the applicable operating rules, or the 
 Certification Basis must be installed in the helicopter."
NOTE 3,"Information essential to the proper maintenance of the helicopter is contained in the Manufacturer’s Maintenance 
 Manual provided with each helicopter. Life limited components and associated retirement times are presented in 
 Chapter 4 and must be replaced accordingly."
NOTE 4,"The model AW169 rotorcraft employs electronic engine controls, commonly named Full authority Digital Engine 
 Controls (FADEC), that are recognized to be more susceptible to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) than rotorcraft 
 that have non-electronic controls. (EMI may be the result of radiated or conducted interference.) For this reason 
 modifications that add or change systems that have the potential for EMI, must either be qualified to a standard 
 acceptable to the FAA or tested at the time of installation for interference with the FADEC. This type of testing must 
 employ the particular FADEC diagnostic techniques and external diagnostic techniques. The test procedure must be 
 FAA approved."
NOTE 5,"The FAA Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) is identical to the EASA approved RFM; any exceptions unique for FAA 
 are presented on yellow pages marked “EASA approved on behalf of FAA”. They must be included in the FAA 
 manual to reflect the differences noted below:

NOTE 6,"The AW Model AW169 incorporates an integrated avionics system using software-based line replaceable units (LRU) 
 which share a digital signal transmission bus. The software configuration of the AW169, as delivered from production, 
 is critical to the proper operation of the avionics and cockpit instrumentation system. Modification to the LRU 
 software supplied with the AW169, replacement of an LRU with a different LRU, addition of new LRU, or alteration 
 of an LRU interface could adversely affect the airworthiness of the certified software. No changes to the integrated 
 avionics system should be made without coordination with the FAA Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) having 
 jurisdiction over the modifier."
NOTE 7,"The hydraulic fluids must conform to MIL-PRF-83282 or MIL-PRF-87257 n - see LIMITATIONS Section of the 
 approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual."
NOTE 8,"Any changes to the type design of this helicopter by means of an amended type certificate (TC), supplemental type 
 certificate (STC), or amended STC, requiring instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA's) must be submitted thru 
 the project aircraft certification office (ACO) for review and acceptance by the Fort Worth -Aircraft Evaluation Group 
 (FTW-AEG) Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) prior to the aircraft delivery, or upon issuance of the first 
 standard airworthiness certificate for the affected aircraft, whichever occurs later as prescribed by Title 14 CFR 21.50. 
 Type design changes by means of a field approval that require ICA's must have those ICA's reviewed by the field 
 approving FSDO."
NOTE 9,"The AW169 name identifies production batches manufactured in conformity with the same Type Design. Applicable 
 serial numbers: 
  
 S/N 69005: and subsequent, manufactured by Leonardo S.p.a. in Italy."
NOTE 10,"Night Vision Goggle operations may be granted by the local civil aviation authority if the rotorcraft is operated 
 according to the limitations and procedures of RFM 169F0290X001Supplement 16. The rotorcraft configuration 
 involving internal and external light emitting and reflecting equipment approved for use with NVGs is described in
