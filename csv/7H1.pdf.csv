 application for certification is made. For applications for Standard Airworthiness 
 Certificates made after May1, 2004, a review of historical records is needed to determine 
 if the helicopter was delivered to and operated by the military. If the helicopter has 
 military history, the helicopter is not eligible for a Standard Airworthiness Certificate 
 unless a copy of a Standard Airworthiness Certificate issued at the time of delivery to the 
 military is submitted."
Certification Basis,"CAR 10. CAR 6 effective January 15, 1951 including Amendment 6-1 through 6-8, plus 
 Special Conditions notified by the U.S. government to the Government of France in FAA 
 letter of May 28, 1957. 
 Type Certificate No. 7H1 issued January 14, 1958 
 Date of Application October 11, 1955 
 The French Direction Generale de l’Aviation Civile (DGAC) originally type 
 certificated this rotorcraft under its type certificate TC 1. The FAA validated 
 this product under U.S. Type Certificate Number 7H1. Effective September 28, 
 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this 
 product on behalf of the DGAC."
Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on a National Aviation 
 Authority (NAA) Export Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by 
 a representative of the French Generale de l’Aviation Civile (DGAC) on behalf 
 of the European Community. 
 The Export C of A should contain the following statement: “The aircraft covered 
 by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to comply with the type 
 design approved under U.S. Type Certificate Number 7H1 and to be in a 
 condition for safe operation.”"
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. In addition, the 
 following item of equipment is required: 
 (a) SGAC approved Alouette II or Alouette Astazou Flight Manual, as applicable."
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the 
 European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before 
 September 28, 2003 – by the French Generale de l’Aviation Civile (DGAC). 
 Any such documents are accepted by the FAA and are considered FAA 
 approved. 
  
 Service Bulletin, 
  
 Structural repair manuals, 
  
 Vendor manuals, 
  
 Aircraft flight manuals, and 
  
 Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 This applies only to the acceptance of the type design data."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and 
 loading instructions when necessary, must be provided for each helicopter at the time of original 
 certification. In order to obtain the most consistent weight and balance results, all model helicopters should 
 be weighed on jackpoints rather than on skids, wheels or floads. When changes are made to the helicopter 
 which affect the weight and balance refer to the Flight Manual for instructions. 
 The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of gravity location must include unusable fuel of 26 
 lb. (120) and undrainable oil of 2.2 lb. (162.2 for models SE 3130, SE 313B and 172.5 for models SA 3180, 
 SA 318B and SA 318C)."
NOTE 2,"The following placards must be displayed:
