Production basis,Production Certificate Number 700.
Required equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see certification basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. The required 
 equipment is included in the type design data. See appropriate Weight and Balance 
 Manuals and Note 8 for replacement passenger seats."
Service information,"Boeing Report D6-4062, “Structural Repair Manual” is FAA-approved. Service 
 bulletins and other service information when FAA-approved, will carry a statement 
 to that effect."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance document, including list of equipment included in certificated weight empty and 
 loading instructions, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter, 
 except in the case of operators having an approved weight control system."
NOTE 2,The aircraft must be operated in accordance with the FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual.
