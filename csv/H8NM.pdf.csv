 satisfactory flight test."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment, as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see certification basis), must be installed in the helicopter for certification. In addition, 
 equipment necessary for the particular special purpose must be FAA engineering 
 approved. External Cargo Operations, Part 133, shall be conducted as specified in 
 NAVAIR 01-110HCA-1 Flight Manual. See also Navair Weight and Balance Data, 
 Navair 01-1B-40."

 nose section)."
Leveling Means,Plumb line from top of left main door frame.
NOTE 1,"The generator speed as shown under ""Engine Limits"" are maximum permissible speeds. The torque pressure 
 output by the engine torque sensing system and the gas generator speed for rated power output varies with 
 individual engines and must be determined during engine calibration and stamped on the engine data plate. The 
 torque pressure and gas generator speed shall be adjusted and displayed on the limit placard (P/N 204-70-149) 
 installed on the instrument panel and must correspond to the engine data plate. Gas generator speed limits also 
 vary with OAT in accordance with the schedule as shown on the limit placard (P/N 204-70-149) on the instrument 
 panel."
NOTE 2,"Current weight and balance report including list of required equipment and list of equipment included in

 may be used in fuel for this helicopter."
NOTE 10,"Gross weights above 8500 lbs. are limited to External Cargo Load only and must not be imposed on the landing 
 gear. The retirement times listed in Note 4 are not changed."
NOTE 11,All repairs to this aircraft to be performed in accordance with NAVAIR 01-110HCA-3 Structural Repair Manual.

NOTE 13,"This Type Certificate (TC) has been designated ""ABANDONED"". A “Notice of Intent To Designate as 
 Abandoned Certain Type Certificates Issued in the Restricted Category,” was published by the Federal Aviation 
 Administration (FAA) in the Federal Register on August 8, 2003 (68 FR 47379). That Notice listed this TC. The 
 FAA received no comments on the published Notice. The FAA has been unable to contact this TC holder. Hence, 
 the FAA has determined that this TC holder is not complying with its Continued Operational Safety (COS) 
 responsibilities. Therefore, no additional aircraft will be added to this TC and no additional original airworthiness 
 certificates will be issued based on this TC. The effectiveness of this TC is limited to those aircraft that received 
 original airworthiness certification prior to the incorporation of this note (Date of Incorporation, January 24, 
 2005). Subsequently, if the TC holder is located and assumes their COS responsibilities, the restriction(s) imposed 
 by this note may be lifted."
