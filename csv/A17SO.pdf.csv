 EASA TC in accordance with Article 3 of Commision Regulation (EU) No. 748/2012. 
 The FAA subsequently validated this product as IMPORT TC A17SO. There was no 
 production. 
 Grumman American Aviation Corporation, original holder, date of application August

 Findings of equivalent levels of safety were made for the emergency exit window (FAR 
 23.807), and the airspeed indicator (FAR 23.1545(a))."
Production Basis,"None. Before original airworthiness certification of each aircraft, an FAA representative 
 must perform a detailed inspection for workmanship, materials, conformity with the 
 approved technical data, and a check of the flight characteristics. In the event of an 
 application for a standard airworthiness certificate or, if an applicant intends to produce a 
 new aircraft under 14 CFR §21.183(d), and the applicant is manufacturing, building, or 
 assembling to another person’s type certificate, the applicant must provide written 
 evidence of permission from the type certificate holder. Conduct of such activity without 
 written evidence of permission may be a violation of 49 U.S.C. §44704(a)(3)."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. In addition, 
 Aircraft Flight Manual GA-7, dated September 22, 1977 for serial number 0001 through 
 0040 is required; Pilot's Operating Handbook and Aircraft Flight Manual dated April 10, 
 1978, revised October 15, 1978, for serial number 0041 and subsequent is required."
NOTE 1,"Weight and Balance 
 A current weight and balance report, including the list of equipment included in the certificated empty weight 
 and loading instructions when necessary, must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original 
 certification. 
 The certificated empty weight and corresponding center-of-gravity locations must include undrainable oil 
 and unusable fuel as noted below: 
 Fuel (both tanks) 
 24 lb. at 112.0 
 Oil (both tanks) 
 7.5 lb. at 64.4"
