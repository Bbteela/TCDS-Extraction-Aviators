 by Annex 8 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation. Prior to August 1, 1995, products identified under Type Certificate 
 A3EU were approved by the FAA in accordance with the Federal Aviation Regulation appropriate to Imported Products (FAR 
 21.29). Effective August 1, 1995 and after, these products are to be considered domestic products for the purpose of certification, 
 and Federal Aviation Regulation 21.21 becomes appropriate."
"Effective May 28, 1999, certain models identified as “B” series that had been previously certified by the UK Civil Aviation 
 Authority were added to Type Certificate A3EU and this Data Sheet. The process for type certification of these aircraft is 
 considered analogous to issuance of export airworthiness approvals, with exceptions, as allowed under 14 CFR 21.325(c). 
 Under that section the requirements that are not met and the differences in configuration, if any, between the product to be exported 
 and the related type certificated product, are listed on the export airworthiness approval as exceptions. The UK certificated “B” 
 series aircraft can be considered to be the US approved type certificated “A” series with exceptions. The UK approved “B” series 
 are eligible to receive FAA airworthiness certificates and registration for operation in the United States as a US approved “B” series 
 when modified to comply with US standards (i.e. the modification eliminates the exception; see NOTE 50) and when all 
 Airworthiness Directives applicable to the equivalent “A” series have been incorporated. 
 The box in the upper right corner of page 1 identifies the FAA Approved Series and Models. The FAA has accepted the 
 information for all such products in accordance with Annex 8. The Type Certificate Holder designated in this data sheet holds 
 Type Design authority for the production of data associated with all such products.

 Viper 601-22 engines, (ii) increased maximum ramp, brake release, landing and zero fuel weights, (iii) increased maximum 
 operating speed (VMO), rough air speed (VRA), flap operating speeds (VFE), and landing gear operating speed (VLE), (iv) 
 increased fuselage length, (v) increased fuel capacity by the addition of an extra fuel tank in the dorsal fairing, (vi) revised

 engines replace the Garrett AiResearch TFE 731-3 engines, (ii) The wing span is increased by 4 ft. 6 ins, (iii) Curved 
 windscreens replace the existing flat panels, (iv) The rear fuselage underfairing is reshaped and the ventral tank is 
 increased in capacity. The ventral fin is deleted, (v) The fin leading edge is extended forward and the dorsal fuel tank 
 deleted, (vi) The nose wheel doors are sequenced to close after the gear is down, (vii) A stall identification (stick pusher) 
 system is fitted, (viii) An Electronic Flight Instrument System (E.F.I.S.) is fitted, (ix) Increase in certificated taxiing, take- 
 off, landing and zero fuel weights, and (x) Increase of MMO from 0.77 to 0.80. (See NOTE 36 & 42).

 XXI. Hawker 750 (Transport Aircraft) Approved February 08, 2008 (See NOTES 1, 2, 3, 8, 63, 64 & 70). 
 The Hawker 750 differs respectively from the Hawker 800XP, which retains the certification basis and is similar in"
a,"External Baggage Unit: The Hawker 750 incorporates as standard equipment, an external baggage unit in place of 
 the aft ventral fuel tank installed on the Hawker 800XP. The standard configuration of the Hawker 750 uses the 
 previously certified external baggage unit with improvements. This baggage unit meets the requirements of 14 CFR 
 25.857(d)(1)(2)(3)(5) as Amended through 25-32 for Class D baggage compartments."
b,"MTOW: The range and MTOW of the Hawker 750 is less than that of the Hawker 800XP as a result of the decrease 
 in available fuel. Changes to the weight and center of gravity envelope reflect the alternative loading capabilities 
 provided with the external baggage unit."
c,"Avionics: Hawker 750 Pro Line 21 avionics installation is revised to include a single FMS-6000/Single GPS in lieu 
 of a dual installation."

NOTE 50,"Some aircraft delivered new from the UK to international customers may not necessarily comply in full

 There are two basic certification standards for the DH/HS/BH/BAe.125/Hawker series of airplanes. One 
 is the US FAA Type Certificate standard. Aircraft certified to this standard are identified with an “A” in the 
 Model suffix. The other certification standard is based on requirements established by the UK Civil Aviation 
 Authority (CAA). Aircraft certified to the UK CAA standards are identified as “B” versions and include the 
 following Models, Series: 1B, 1B-522, 1B/S-522, 1B/R-522, 3B, 3B/R, 3B/RA, 3B/RB, 3B/RC, F3B, F3B/RA,

 1000B. The ‘B’ models are equivalent to the ‘A’ models and meet U.S. certification requirements with the 
 exception of the overriding UK CAA requirements and customer requested optional modifications approved by 
 the UK CAA. While most countries outside of the UK and U.S. accept either “A”, “B”, or both versions of the 
 aircraft, modifications of these aircraft are sometimes required to satisfy national variations in the certification 
 standards established by the importing countries. Due to the wide range of potential configurations, specific 
 instructions for modifying an airplane from one country standard to another are not available in a pre-published 
 format. In those cases, where it does become necessary to convert an aircraft from one certification standard to 
 another, or to show the equivalency to the U. S. standard, the document used will be a serial number specific 
 Service Bulletin issued by the Type Certificate Holder. This Service Bulletin will be FAA Approved."

NOTE 65,"Master Drawing List 800E0165 introduces the FAA approved modifications for the Hawker 800XP aircraft 
 for operation by the Brazilian Air Force for Airborne Flight Inspection Operations. A Hawker 800XP aircraft 
 modified as specified above must be operated in accordance with the Approved Flight Manual Document No. 
 HS 1.22 containing Supplement 9, Issue 2. The following serial numbered aircraft were modified per the 
 above master drawing list 258401, 258421, 258434 and 258447."
NOTE 66,"Airplane models 125-1000A and Hawker 1000 are the subject of Special Condition related to operation at 
 high altitude. This special condition includes pressurization system requirements, as well as damage 
 tolerance requirements on the pressure vessel. Therefore, any changes to the pressurization system or 
 modifications or repairs to the pressure vessel must be approved in accordance with the requirements defined 
 in the special condition. 
 The damage tolerance requirements in the special condition are specified in terms of cabin altitude time 
 history, which is a function of the cabin leak rate. For models 125-1000A and Hawker 1000 the specified 
 cabin altitude time history requirement can be met with a pressure vessel opening of 3.0 square inches, 
 (assuming an emergency descent). The determination of an equivalent crack length will depend upon the 
 particular location of the crack, the pressure vessel configuration in that location, and the direction of the 
 crack, etc. The approval of modifications and/or repairs must take into account the requirements of the 
 special condition and how they apply to the particular location and configuration being modified or repaired. 
 The resulting inspection program must also consider other applicable structural criteria."
