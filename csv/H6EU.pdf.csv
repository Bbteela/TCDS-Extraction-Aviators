 an approved auxiliary priming unit containing one of the fuels marked thus * 
 is: 
 - recommended in all cases 
 - necessary if temperature is below +20°C 
 The following additives are approved for use:

Serial Nos Eligible,"The French Government ""Certificat de Navigabilite pour Exportation"" endorsed as noted 
 below under ""Import Requirements"" must be submitted for each individual aircraft for 
 which application for FAA certification is made."
Certification basis,"FAR 21.29 and FAR 27 effective 1 February 1965 plus Amendments 27-1 through 27-4 
 plus Conditions Speciales Techniques Complementaires notified to FAA by SGAC in 
 letter 4987/DTA.M dated 2 September 1971, plus FAA Special Conditions No. 27-45- 
 EU-13 dated 14 September 1972. 
 Type Certificate No. H6EU issued 18 September 1972. 
 Date of application for type certificate: 28 January 1971. 
 The French Direction Generale de l’Aviation Civile (DGAC) originally type 
 certificated this rotorcraft under its type certificate TC 66. The FAA validated this 
 product under U.S. Type Certificate Number H6EU. Effective September 28, 
 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this 
 product on behalf of the DGAC."
Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on a National Aviation 
 Authority (NAA) Export Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a 
 representative of the French Generale de l’Aviation Civile (DGAC) on behalf of 
 the European Community. 
 The Export C of A should contain the following statement: “The aircraft covered 
 by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to comply with the type 
 design approved under U.S. Type Certificate Number H6EU and to be in a 
 condition for safe operation.”"
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the European 
 Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before September 28, 
 2003 – by the French Generale de l’Aviation Civile (DGAC). Any such 
 documents are accepted by the FAA and are considered FAA approved. 
  
 Service Bulletin, 
  
 Structural repair manuals, 
  
 Vendor manuals, 
  
 Aircraft flight manuals, and 
  
 Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 This applies only to the acceptance of the type design data."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the helicopter for certification. 
 In addition, the following item of equipment is required: 
 DGAC-approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual (Code B), approved 
 December 1974 for Model SA341G and April 1976 for Model SA342J."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including loading instructions and list of equipment included in the 
 certificated empty weight, must be provided for each helicopter at the time of original certification. The 
 certification empty weight and corresponding center of gravity location must include undrainable oil of 3.3 
 lb. at 154, and unusable fuel of 3.5 lb., at (+138 in.) with and without auxiliary fuel tank. 
 In order to obtain the most consistent weight and balance results, all helicopters should be weighed on 
 jackpoints rather than on wheels and floats. When changes are made to the helicopter which affect the 
 weight and balance, refer to the Flight Manual for instructions."
NOTE 2,"The following placard must be displayed in clear view of the pilot: 
 ""THIS HELICOPTER MUST BE OPERATED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE OPERATING 
 LIMITATIONS SPECIFIED IN THE APPROVED ROTORCRAFT FLIGHT MANUAL."" 
 ""THE AIRWORTHINESS LIMITATIONS SECTION OF THE ROTORCRAFT MAINTENANCE 
 MANUAL MUST BE COMPLIED WITH"". 
 The other placards as indicated in the Rotorcraft Flight Manual must be installed in the appropriate location."
NOTE 3,"Information essential to the proper maintenance of the helicopter is contained in the Manufacturer's Gazelle 
 Maintenance Manual provided with each helicopter, which specifies that service life limited parts be retired 
 in accordance with Chapter 5 approved by DGAC."
Note 4,"Effective January 1, 2014, Eurocopter France name was changed to Airbus Helicopters."
