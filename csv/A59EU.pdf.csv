 Leveling Means 
 Three leveling marks are provided to level the airplane: one is located on the 
 forward mast of cabin door, the other two are located each side to the fuselage, 
 close to the rearmost baggage compartment frame. The airplane may be leveled 
 either on jacks or on wheels using the communicating vessel system and 
 deflecting the tires or the shock absorbers. 
 Normally the airplane is leveled first laterally then longitudinally. 
 Some aircraft may have longitudinal level marks on the external power receptacle 
 housing, and lateral level marks on the external power receptacle housing and on 
 the ground test refueling panel housing.

 The Ente Nazionale per l’Aviazone Civile (ENAC) originally type ertificated 
 this aircraft under its Type Certificate Number A390. Effective September 28, 
 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this 
 product under their Type certificate Number A059 on behalf of Italy. 
 Validation Basis 
 Type Certificate A59EU was issued pursuant to FAR 21.29 in validation of EASA 
 certification of compliance with the aforementioned certification basis, and in 
 accordance with the standard airworthiness certificate provisions of FAR 
 21.183(c). 
 Note: The airworthiness provisions of FAR 21.183(d) may be cited as the basis 
 for issuance of standard airworthiness certificates for aircraft imported from a 
 country other than the country of manufacture. 
 Equipment 
 The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for 
 airworthiness certification.In addition, the following item of equipment is 
 required: 
 1. POH and AFM, Report No. 6591, approved July 7, 1992 (RAI Ltr 
 282.378/SCMA), or later approved revision (S/N 1004 through 1025 
 incorporating SB 80-0023 or 1026 through 1104). 
 2. AFM, Report No. 180-MAN-0010-01100 (EASA approval date:October 21, 
 2005) and W&B M, Report No. 180-MAN-0020-01101 (EASA approval 
 date: October 21, 2005) (S/N 1002 and 1105 to subsequent). 
 Import requirements The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export 
 Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the 
 the Ente Nazionale per l’Aviazone Civile (ENAC) on behalf of the European 
 Community. The Export C of A should contain the following statement “ The 
 aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to 
 comply with EASAs TC No A059 approved under U.S. Type Certificate No. 
 A 59EU and to be in a condition for safe operation”. 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into 
 the United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the 
 agreement, to identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the 
 export certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures 
 for coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer 
 to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements 
 for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft. 
 Country other than Manufacturer (U.S. bilateral agreement and the original 
 Export Certificate of Airworthiness issued by the country of manufacture must 
 exist): A U.S. airworthiness certificate may be issued on the basis of a log book 
 certifying statement endorsed by an authorized representative of the civil aviation 
 authority of the exporting country. It is incumbent upon the exporting civil 
 aviation authority to determine that the certifying statement includes evidence of 
 acceptable service history and modification deviations and the following 
 statement: ""The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, 
 inspected in accordance with the provisions of FAR 21.183)d) or its equivalent, 
 and found to conform to the type design approved under Type Certificate A59EU 
 and is in a condition for safe operation"". 
 Service Information 
 Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the 
 European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before 
 September 28, 2003- by the Ente Nazionale per l’Aviazone Civile (ENAC) 
 · Service bulletins 
 · Structural Repair Manuals 
 · Vendor Manuals 
 · Aircraft Flight Manuals, and 
 · Overhaul and Maintenance Manuals 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved 
 unless one of the following condition exists: 
 · The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures 
 of the FAA approved manuals; or 
 · The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this 
 product’s U.S.type certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these 
 documents. The FAA may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to 
 approve on behalf of the FAA for the U.S. type certificate. If this is the 
 case it will be noted on the document.
