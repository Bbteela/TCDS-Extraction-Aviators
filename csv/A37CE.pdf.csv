 asterisk (*) must also be displayed as permanent markings."
NOTE 6,"Special Ferry Flight Authorization. Flight Standards District Offices are authorized to issue special 
 overweight ferry flight authorizations. These airplanes are structurally satisfactory for ferry flight if 
 maintained within the following limits: (1) Takeoff weight must not exceed the maximum certified takeoff 
 weight multiplied by a gross weight increase factor up to 1.3 (e.g. 8,000 x 1.3 = 10,400 lb); (2) the 
 Maximum Operating Airspeed (VMO) must be divided by the same gross weight increase factor (e.g. VMO = 
 175 ÷ 1.3 = 135 KIAS); (3) Forward and aft center of gravity limits may not be exceeded: and (4) 
 Structural load factors of +2.5 g. to -1.0 g. may not be exceeded. This determination is based upon the 
 production configuration of the airplane and does not account for modifications, such as STCs, that may 
 have affected the gross weight of the airplane. The excess weight authorized is limited to the additional 
 fuel, fuel-carrying tanks, and navigational equipment necessary for the flight. Requirements for any 
 additional engine oil should be established in accordance with Advisory Circular AC 23.1011-1. Increased 
 stall speeds and reduced climb performances should be expected for the increased weights. Flight 
 characteristics and performance at the increase weights have not been evaluated. Procedures for issuing a 
 Flight Permit for operations of overweight aircraft may be found in Advisory Circular AC 21-4."
