 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 21.29 and exported by the 
 country of manufacture is FAR Sections 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 21.29 exported from 
 countries other than the country of manufacture (e.g. third party country) is FAR 21.183(d) or 21.185(b). 
 Notwithstanding that the FAR referenced in the above paragraph does not specifically address or require a foreign 
 civil airworthiness authority certification, such certification is the only practical way for an applicant to show, and 
 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to find conformity to the FAA-approved type design and conditions for"
safe operation,"Engines, Propellers, and Related Products Imported into the United States."

"The 900C designation for the Mystere-Falcon 900 does not correspond to a model designation. It is only a commercial

 M1975 Avionics upgrade  production 
 M2695 Avionics upgrade – retrofit 
 The M1975 and M2695 modifications consists of a complete upgrade of the basic Mystere-Falcon 900 avionics, by installation 
 of a variant of the Honeywell Primus 2000 suite. M1975 is basic on all Mystere-Falcon 900 aircraft produced from serial 
 number 179 and subsequent

 a Basic Model Definition 
 The Falcon 900EX is defined by Dassault modification M3000 and differs from the Mystere-Falcon 900 in the following major 
 respects: (i) Allied Signal Engines TFE 731-60 replace TFE 731-5AR-1C or TFE 731-5BR-1C engines; (ii) A new aft fuel tank 
 is added, and the forward central fuel tank is increased in capacity; (iii) The instrument panel is changed by the installation of a 
 new avionics suite, including Honeywell Primus 2000 five tube EFIS including autothrottle; (iv) bleed air system is modified by 
 components, and use of Falcon 2000 type electrical wires; (vi) an increase in maximum weights.",

 (b) Falcon 900EX EASy Definition (Approved November 14, 2003)"
"EASy designation for Falcon 900EX does not correspond to a model designation. This is only a commercial designation for 
 airplanes on which a Major modification number M3083 has been embodied. 
 Major Change Modification number M3083 to the Falcon 900EX consists of the installation of an Enhanced Avionics System 
 (EASy) based on the Honeywell “Primus EPIC” product line. This system architecture is mainly built around 2 cabinets called 
 Modular Avionics Units (MAU), 2 Modular Radio Cabinets (MRC), 2 Audio panels, 2 reversionary panels and 4 14.1 inch 
 Liquid Crystal Displays. The pilots have access to the system using the 2 CCDs with multipurpose knob, menu pushbutton,

 All parameters listed in the preceding sub-section (a) for the basic Falcon 900EX remain valid for airplanes which incorporate 
 M3083 
 (c) Falcon 900DX Definition (Approved November 3, 2005) 
 The DX definition of the Falcon 900EX does not correspond to a model designation. The Falcon 900DX is only a commercial

 with serial number 601 and subsequent. 
 All parameters listed in the preceding sub-sections (a and b) for the Falcon 900EX and EASy designation remain valid for 
 airplanes which incorporate M3083, M3876, M4000, M3555, M3755, M5047, M5012, M5046 and M3987, except for the
