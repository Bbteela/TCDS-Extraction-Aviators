 Certification Office, ASW-170."
Certification Basis,"14 CFR § 21.25(a)(2) effective February 1, 1965, including Amendments 21-1 
 through 21-42. 
 Type Certificate R00004RC issued February 14, 2013, for the special purpose 
 of: 
 1) 
 Agricultural Operations under § 21.25(b)(1). 
 Note: In accordance with § 36.1(a)(4), compliance with the noise 
 requirements was not shown. Therefore, aircraft certified under this type 
 certificate are only eligible for agricultural operations excepted by § 
 36.1(a)(4) and defined under § 137.3. 
 2) 
 Forest and Wildlife Conservation under § 21.25(b)(2). 
 Note: In accordance with § 36.1(a)(4), compliance with the noise 
 requirements was not shown. Therefore, aircraft certified under this type 
 certificate are only eligible for dispensing of fire fighting materials, as 
 excepted by § 36.1(a)(4). 
 3) 
 External Load Operations under 14 CFR § 21.25(b)(7). 
 Note: In accordance with 14 CFR § 36.1(a)(4), compliance with noise 
 requirements was not shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this type 
 certificate are only eligible for external load operations excepted by 14 CFR § 
 36.1(a)(4) and defined under 14 CFR § 133.1(b). 
 Any alteration to the aircraft for special purposes not identified above require 
 further FAA approval and in addition may require noise and/or flight testing. 
 General Note: Any subsequent modifications to the helicopters type certified 
 under this type certificate are to have the certification basis for that 
 modification established under 14 CFR § 21.101 published June 7, 2000 which 
 became effective June 10, 2003. Otherwise non-significant modifications are 
 to meet the requirements of 14 CFR part 29 Airworthiness Standards, 
 Transport Category, Amendment 1, effective August 12, 1965 and 14 CFR § 
 29.1529, Instructions for Continued Airworthiness, Amendment 20, effective 
 September 11, 1980."
Production Basis,"None. No helicopter may be manufactured under this approval. Prior to 
 adding serial numbers to this type certificate, each candidate helicopter must 
 undergo a conformity inspection. The conformity inspection will be conducted 
 in accordance with a Type Inspection Authorization, Part 1, or request for 
 conformity using the conformity inspection guidelines contained in FAA Order 
 8110.56."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (see certification basis) must be installed in the helicopter prior to 
 original airworthiness certification. In addition, the following items or 
 equipment are required with each helicopter as specified: 
 (a) 
 Outside air temperature gauge 
 (b) 
 Engine tail pipe temperature gauge 
 (c) 
 The U.S. Army UH-1H Operator’s Manual TM 55-1520-210-10, dated 15 
 February 1988 or later FAA approved revisions."
NOTE 1,"A current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in the certificated empty 
 weight, and loading instructions when necessary, must be provided for each helicopter at the time 
 of original airworthiness certification. Refer to Chapter 6 of UH-1H Operator’s Manual TM 55- 
 1520-210-10 and Maintenance Manual TM 55-1520-210-23, paragraph 1-36 for leveling means 
 and weight and balance determination."
NOTE 2,"Torque pressure output by the engine sensing system varies with individual engines. A calibration 
 of this value is required of each engine and the value corresponding to take-off power is stamped 
 on the engine data plate."
NOTE 3,"Gas producer speeds, as shown under “Engine Limits”, are maximum permissible speeds. The gas 
 producer speed for rated power outputs varies with individual engines and must be determined 
 during engine calibration and is stamped on the engine data plate. The rated gas producer speed 
 shown on the temperature limit placard installed on the instrument panel must correspond to the 
 engine data plate gap producer speed. Gas producer speed limits also vary with outside air 
 temperature in accordance with the schedule as shown on the Temperature Limit (GO-NO-GO 
 TAKE-OFF) placard on the instrument panel."
NOTE 4,"The following placards must be prominently displayed in the cockpit on the instrument panel and in 
 full view of the pilot:

NOTE 5,"These helicopters must be serviced, maintained, inspected, repaired and overhauled in accordance 
 with the documents specified in JJASPP Engineering, LLC Instructions for Continued 
 Airworthiness Report No. JJASPP-ICA-12-005, Rev. IR, or later FAA accepted revision, or

 Other maintenance methods, techniques and practices maybe used as an alternative to these 
 manuals, provided the maintenance methods, techniques, and practices have been determined to be 
 acceptable to the FAA."
NOTE 6,"The following helicopter configuration and condition requirements must be met prior to original 
 airworthiness certification of each UH-1H helicopter: 
 (a) Each helicopter must pass a conformity inspection in accordance with JJASPP Engineering, 
 LLC Engineering Configuration Report No. JJASPP-RC-12-001, dated September 19, 2012, or 
 later FAA approved revision. The configuration report identifies the military maintenance work 
 orders associated with each helicopter and provides a description of the modifications 
 accomplished on each helicopter. In addition, each helicopter must pass an inspection for any 
 possible hidden damage and the military records reviewed for acceptability of any repairs or 
 alterations. 
 (b) The maintenance, overhaul and modification records of each helicopter must be reviewed for 
 military changes that may affect the airworthiness of the helicopter. 
 (c) After the required inspections, the helicopter must be found to be in a good state of 
 preservation, repair, and in a condition for safe operation. 
 (d) An FAA representative must perform a detailed inspection for workmanship, materials and

 Worth Aircraft Evaluation Group (FTW-AEG). Type design changes by means of a Field 
 Approval that require ICA’s must have those ICA’s reviewed by the Flight Standards District 
 (Office) managing the Field Approval or the FTW-AEG."
