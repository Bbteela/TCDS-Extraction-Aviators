 The United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority originally type certificated this aircraft 
 under its type certificate. The FAA validated this product under U.S. Type Certificate 
 Number A15EU. Effective September 28, 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency 
 (EASA) began oversight of this product on behalf of the United Kingdom. Currently there 
 is not an EASA TCDS number for this airplane."
Import requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export Certificate of 
 Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the United Kingdom Civil 
 Aviation Authority on behalf of the European Community. The Export C of A should 
 contain the following statement: ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been 
 examined, tested, and found to comply with U.S. airworthiness regulations 14 CFR Federal 
 Aviation Regulations Part 23, effective February 1, 1965 including Amendments 23-1, 23- 
 2 and 23-3 plus Special Conditions notified by the U.S. Government to the Government of 
 the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland in their letters April 1, 1966 and October 19, 
 1966 under U.S. Type Certificate No. A15EU and to be in a condition for safe operation.’"
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the European Aviation 
 Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before September 28, 2003 – by the Air 
 Registration Board Through the manufacturers ARB Approval, Ref: AD/1023/45, or the 
 United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority. 
 • Service bulletins, 
 • Structural repair manuals, 
 • Vendor manuals, 
 • Aircraft flight manuals, and 
 • Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved for type design data 
 only unless one of the following conditions exists: 
 • The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures of the FAA 
 approved manuals; or 
 •The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this product’s U.S. type 
 certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. The FAA 
 may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to approve on behalf of the FAA for the U.S. type 
 certificate. If this is the case it will be noted on the document."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations (see 
 Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. 
 For Series 2 aircraft: See SBH publication reference SC/-SVE-1 details. 
 For Series 3 aircraft: See SBH publication reference SC7-EAS/1 details. 
 In addition the following items of equipment are required:- 
 (a) 
 Stall Warning Indicator (Safe Flight Ltd. Type No. 165). 
 (b) 
 ARB Approved Flight Manual Doc. No. SBH.2.4 (for Series 2 aircraft).

NOTE 1,"(a) Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certified empty weight, and loading 
 instructions when necessary, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times 
 thereafter (except in the case of operators having an approved weight control system). 
 (b) ""Unusable Fuel and System Oil"" and all hydraulic fluid must be included in the certified empty weight. 
 Unusable fuel is that quantity of fuel in the system and in the tanks which is unavailable to the engine under 
 critical flight conditions as defined in FAR. This unusable fuel includes ""system fuel"" which is defined as the 
 quantity required to fill the system and tanks to the tank outlet level when the airplane is in the ground level 
 altitude. The fuel gauges are calibrated with the unusable fuel level as the zero datum. The total amount of 
 fuel is as follows: 
 Usable Fuel
