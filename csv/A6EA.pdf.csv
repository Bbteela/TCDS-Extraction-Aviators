Certification basis,"CAR 3 dated May 15, 1956, plus Amendments 3-1 through 3-8, plus CAR 4b.356 
 (except for the requirement enabling the main cabin door to be opened from the 
 outside). Date of Application for Type Certificate February 2, 1963."
Production basis,"None. Prior to original certification of each aircraft an FAA representative must 
 perform a detailed inspection for workmanship, materials, and conformity with the 
 approved technical data, and a check of the flight characteristics. 
 Determine that all unmodified parts (parts built under the original Republic RC-3 
 Type Certificate No. 769) are in an airworthy and unaltered condition. 
 This determination may be accomplished by means of an examination of the 
 aircraft records, and to the extent possible, a visual inspection of the aircraft original 
 parts. Particular attention should be given to the following areas: 
 (1) The rudder spar at each of the rudder-fin hinges 
 (2) Both main landing gear (especially the actuating tube at the weld) 
 (3) The elevator torque tube fittings 
 (4) The hull fuel cells (for evidence of deterioration) 
 Any Republic Model RC-3 parts which may have been altered must be substantiated 
 by the applicant to the controlling region of the Republic Model RC-3 aircraft. 
 For information concerning the United Consultants Model UC-1 modification contact 
 the controlling region of the United Consultants Model UC-1 aircraft."

 corresponding center of gravity location must include unusable fuel (included in main 
 tank capacity) of 9 lb. at (+116.0”) and system oil (not included in oil capacity) of 4 lb. 
 at (+101.9”)"
NOTE 2,"All placards required in the FAA approved airplane flight manual must be installed
