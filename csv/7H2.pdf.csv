 Each helicopter and any replacement parts manufactured in France must be designated

 A U.S. airworthiness certificate may be issued on the basis of a Certificate of 
 Airworthiness for Export signed by a representative of the Secretariat General a 
 l'Aviation Civile et Commerciale (SGACC), containing the following statement: ""The 
 helicopter covered by this certificate has been examined and found to comply with U.S. 
 Civil Air Regulation Part 6, dated January 15, 1951, including Amendments 6-1 
 through 6-6 and with the Special Requirements notified to the Government of France by 
 the United States of America."""

 (see certification basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated weight empty, and 
 loading instructions when necessary, must be in each helicopter at the time of original certification and at 
 all times thereafter. In order to obtain the most consistent weight and balance results, all model helicopters 
 should be weighed on jack- points rather than on skids. When changes are made to the helicopter which 
 affect the weight and balance refer to the Flight Manual for instructions. 
 The certificated weight empty and corresponding C.G> location must include unusable fuel of 3.3 lbs. 
 (+68.9) and undrainable oil of 2.2 lb. (+74.8)."
