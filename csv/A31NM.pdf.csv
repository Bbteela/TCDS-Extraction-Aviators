 of this data sheet."
Certification Basis,The certification basis is FAR 21.25 (a) (2)
Production Basis,"None - Prior to original certification of each aircraft, an FAA representative must perform 
 an inspection for workmanship, materials, and conformity with the approved technical 
 data. All applicable Technical Orders affecting airworthiness must be accomplished."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable Airworthiness Regulations 
 (see Certification Basis), must be installed in the aircraft for certification."
NOTE 1,"This approval applies to:

 as required by Hemet Valley Flying Service Drawing List HVFS-130-DL-110 Revision 
 NC, or later FAA approved revisions. 
 B. 
 Airplane certified for the special purpose of carriage of cargo with the following 
 limitations: 
 1. In addition to the operating limitations in this data sheet, area, 
 economic, passenger, and other appropriate operating limitations in 
 accordance with FAR 21.25 shall be shown on placards or listings 
 accessible to the pilot. 
 2. 
 The following placard is to be installed in clear view of the pilot. 
 “RESTRICTED CATEGORY” 
 “This airplane must be operated as a restricted category airplane and in 
 compliance with the operating limitations stated in USAF T.O. 1C-130A-1 
 section V and in the form of placards markings and manuals.” 
 3. 
 Carriage of hazardous materials is prohibited unless compliance is shown with 
 the applicable regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations 49, Part 175 (see 
 AC 21-17, pg. 2, para. 4a (3))."
NOTE 2,"A. Current Weight and Balance Report including list of equipment included in 
 certificated weight empty, and loading instructions when necessary must be in each 
 aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter. 
 B. 
 The location of the center of gravity for any gross weight configuration, determined 
 from T.O. 1-1B-40, Handbook of Weight and Balance Data, must fall within the 
 percent of the mean aerodynamic chord (MAC) shown on the Center of Gravity 
 Limitations Chart (figure 5-6). For information and method of calculating the 
 airplane center of gravity, refer to T.O. 1C-130A-9, Cargo Loading Handbook and 
 T.O. 1-1B-40, Handbook of Weight and Balance Data. 
 C. 
 The weight of the system fuel and oil as defined below, and hydraulic fluid, must be 
 included in the airplane empty weight.

 D. Fuel Loading and Usage 
 1. 
 Fuel must be loaded and used to provide compliance with the “Fuel 
 Unbalance” limitation contained in USAF T.O. 1C-130A-1. Refer to USAF 
 T.O. 1C-130A-1 for normal fuel management procedures. 
 2. 
 Phillips fuel additive PFA-55MB may be used in concentrations not to exceed 
 0.15 percent by volume. No fuel system anti-icing credit is allowed."
NOTE 3,"Latest revisions of the following documents are required: 
 A. USAF T.O. 1C-130A-1, Change 2, dated March 22, 1981, and USAF T.O. 1C-
