Serial Nos eligible,"The United Kingdom Certificate of Airworthiness for export endorsed as noted under 
 ""Certification basis"" must be submitted for each individual aircraft for which application 
 for certification is made."
Certification basis,"CAR 10. Type Certificate No. A2IN issued May 25, 1962 
 Date of Application for Type Certificate June 17, 1957. 
 Each aircraft and any replacement parts manufactured in the U.K. must be designated as 
 ""import"" and clearly labeled as such in accordance with CAR 10.30. A U.S. Airworthiness 
 Certificate may be issued on basis of a United Kingdom Certificate of Airworthiness for 
 Export signed by a representative of the Ministry of Aviation containing the following 
 notation: ""The aeroplane covered by this certificate has been examined and found to 
 comply with the British Civil Airworthiness Requirements (1959) and the Special 
 Requirements for Herald Aircraft notified by the U.S.A. Government to the Government of 
 the United Kingdom and conforms to T.C. A2IN."" (This certification equivalent to CAR 
 4b effective December 31, 1953, plus Amendments 4b-1 thru 4b-11 and SR-422B dated 
 July 9, 1959.) 
 Compliance with the ditching requirements has been demonstrated."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations (see 
 Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. The following 
 additional equipment is required: 
 (a) Stall Warning Indicator, Kelvin & Hughes Type No. KSB.0213. 
 (b) Stick Shaker, Western Manufacturing Type No. CCV.161."
NOTE 1,"(a) Current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and 
 loading instructions when necessary, must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original certification. 
 (b) ""Unusable Fuel and System Oil"" and all hydraulic fluid must be included in the certificated empty weight. 
 Unusable fuel is that quantity of fuel in the system and in the tanks which is unavailable to the engine under 
 critical flight conditions as defined in CAR 4b.416. This unusable fuel includes ""system fuel"" which is 
 defined as the quantity required to fill the system and tanks to the tank outlet level when the airplane is in 
 the ground level attitude. The fuel gauges are calibrated with the unusable fuel level as the zero datum. The 
 total amount of fuel is as follows: 
 Usable fuel 
 Unusable fuel 
 Undrainable fuel 
 (that is downstream 
 Using pressure 
 of booster pumps) 
 de-fueling unit 
 1312 U.S. gal. 
 24 lb. total 
 96 lb. total 
 System Oil is that amount of oil required to fill the oil systems and tanks to the tank outlets to the engines. 
 The propeller feathering oil is not considered usable oil and is included in ""System Oil"". System oil weight 
 is 86 lb. The oil tank capacities shown in this data sheet include only the usable oil for which the tanks are 
 placarded. Dipstick readings indicate the amount of usable oil."
NOTE 2,"The following is a list of aircraft parts which are critical from the fatigue standpoint at less than 15,000 flights 
 and must be replaced at the times specified."
Cable Part No P04884 B1,750 flights
All other flap cables,"3,500 flights"
Parts P04877 B1 and P04878,"1,000 flights"
All other flap chains,"10,000 flights 
 Other aircraft parts that are critical from a fatigue standpoint at 15,000 or more flights will be included herein 
 as further testing and operational experience is evaluated."
NOTE 3,All aircraft must be maintained and repaired in accordance with the Air Registration Board approved
NOTE 4,A FAA Certificate of Airworthiness is not to be issued until compliance is found to SFAR 88.
