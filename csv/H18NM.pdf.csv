 special purpose of: 
 1) 
 Agricultural Operations under § 21.25(b)(1). 
 Note: In accordance with Part 36 § 36.1(a)(4), compliance with the noise 
 requirements was not shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this type 
 certificate are only eligible for agricultural operations except by § 36.1(a)(4) 
 and defined under § 137.3. 
 Note: In accordance with § 36.1(a)(4), compliance with the noise requirements
