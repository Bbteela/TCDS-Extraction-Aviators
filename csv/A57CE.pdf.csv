 dated 01-Apr-2015, or a later approved revision.."
Import requirements,"a) For aircraft produced in Austria, The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based 
 on an NAA Export Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of 
 the Austro Control (ACG) on behalf of the European Community. The Export C of A should 
 contain the following statement “The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, 
 tested, and found to comply with Code of Federal Regulations Part 23 approved under U.S. 
 Type Certificate No. A57CE and to be in a condition for safe operation”. 
 b) For aircraft produced in Canada, a United States airworthiness certificate may be issued on 
 the basis of a Canadian Certificate of Airworthiness for Export signed by a representative of 
 the Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA), containing the following statement (in the 
 English language): ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and 
 found to comply with U.S. type certificate No. A57CE and to be in a condition for safe 
 operation.’ 
 c) The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 
 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR Sections 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). 
 d) The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 
 21.29 exported from countries other than the country of manufacture (e.g., third party 
 country) is FAR Section 21.183(b) or 21.183(d). 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness (or 
 equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of 
 Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft."
