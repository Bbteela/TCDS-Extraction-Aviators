 607. Speedpak external cargo carrier. (Airplane must be operated in accordance with Appendix I 
 to the CAA Approved Operating Manual.) See NOTE 8 for loading and capacities of Speedpak. 
 NOTE 1 
 (a) Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated weight empty, and 
 loading instructions, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter 
 (except in the case of air carrier operators having an approved weight control system). See approved Master 
 Equipment List (LAC Report 6056) for list of approved items of equipment in addition to those items listed in 
 this specification. 
 (b) The airplane must be loaded so that the C.G. is within the specified limits at all times, with the effects of fuel 
 use, gear retraction, and movement of crew and passengers from their assigned positions being considered 
 (retraction of the main and nose gears causes the C.G. to move forward, the change in moment due to this 
 retraction being 139,000 in. lb. for landing gears with wheel Item 202(a), 124,000 in.lb. for wheel Item 
 202(b), and 128,000 in.lb. for wheels Item 202(d) and tires Item 203(e). Add 3,000 in.lb. to each of the 
 above moments when drag strut dampers are installed.) At take-off, the airplane shall be loaded so that, due 
 to fuel use, the C.G. cannot move forward of 18% MAC unless it can be shown that the C.G. can be easily 
 and rapidly shifted in flight (see CAR 4.70) to meet the 18% forward landing limit. The load manifest form 
 shall indicate the exact load shifting necessary during flight. A 34% aft C.G. limit (gear retracted) for 
 cruising flight may be used when the effect of passenger and crew movements from their assigned positions 
 has been taken into account. For Model 49-46 only, see Notes in Approved Operating Manual concerning 
 trim speeds necessary to permit use of 34% aft C.G. limit and concerning operations with take-off C.G. aft of 
 29% MAC. 
 NOTE 2 
 The following placards shall be installed so as to be in full view of the pilots or flight engineer: 
 (a) The following airplane placards for fuel distribution shall be installed: 
 ""This airplane must be fueled and the fuel used in accordance with the chart contained in the Approved 
 Operating Manual."" 
 ""At all times fuel in tanks 2 and 3 must not exceed fuel in tanks 1 and 4, respectively."" 
 ""Fuel transfer from one tank to another is not permitted. When operating the fuel system on crossfeed, the 
 tank not being used must be turned off."" 
 (b) ""This airplane shall be operated in accordance with Part I (Operating Limitations) of the CAA Approved 
 Operating Manual"" (all models). 
 (c) ""Above 16,000 ft. altitude, the maximum level flight or climb speed shall be reduced 5 mph for each 
 additional 1,000 ft. of altitude. Above 13,000 ft. altitude, the maximum glide or dive speed shall be reduced 
 6 mph for each additional 1,000 ft. of altitude,"" or equivalent. 
 (d) ""With de-icer boots installed, the maximum glide or dive speed is 300 mph between sea level and 17,000 ft. 
 altitude. Above 17,000 ft., reduce this maximum speed by 6 mph for each additional 1,000 ft. of altitude,"" or 
 equivalent. 
 (e) ""Do not dump fuel with gear or flaps down or above 218 mph. After dumping fuel, move lever to the red 
 line first, then back to intermediate position for 15-30 seconds before closing."" (To be placed adjacent to 
 dumping controls for fuel tanks Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4.) 
 (f) Unless ""Fasten Seat Belt"" and ""No Smoking"" signs are installed in the forward passenger compartment, one 
 or more crew members shall be instructed to advise the passengers in this compartment when smoking is not 
 permitted or seat belts must be fastened.

 NOTE 5 
 (a) ""System Fuel and Oil"" is that amount required to fill both systems and the tanks up to the tank outlets to the 
 engines, when the airplane is in the level attitude. For these models, the only ""unusable"" fuel is ""System 
 fuel."" (Ref. CAR 4b.112 and 4b.6104.) ""System Fuel and Oil"" and all hydraulic fluid must be included in the

 NOTE 7 
 (a) In order that airplane serials prior to 2045 may be eligible for certification at landing weights over 75,000 
 lbs., and take-off weights above 86,250 lbs., the main landing gear side struts must be replaced and the wing 
 front spars reinforced in accordance with Lockheed Service Instructions Nos. 049/SI-14 and 049/SI-14A. 
 These changes were accomplished by the manufacturer on airplane serials 2045 and up. 
 (b) Model 49-46 is eligible for certification at 93,000 lb. take-off weight when modified in accordance with 
 Lockheed Service Bulletin No. 49/SB-282. This modification includes the addition of external rails to the 
 upper forward portion of the fuselage, modification and reidentification of nose and main landing gear struts 
 and the replacement of nose landing gear wheels and tires. This model is also eligible for certification at 
 83,000 lbs. landing weight when modified in accordance with Lockheed Service Bulletin 49/SB-425. Prior to 
 certification, the pertinent sections of the Operating Manual should be replaced to correspond to the increased 
 take-off and landing weights. 
 (c) Model 49-46 is eligible for certification at 96,000 lbs. take-off weight and 83,000 lbs. landing weight when 
 modified to incorporate reinforcements of the wing and landing gear structures in accordance with LAC 
 Service Bulletin 49/SB-548. 
 (d) Model 49-46, Serial Nos. 1970, 1971, 1974 through 1980 and 2021 through 2088, eligible for certification at

 3Structural zero fuel for the Model 49 at 90,000/93,000 lb. take-off and 77,800 lb. landing weights is 75,960 lbs. For all other 
 models, structural adequacy has been shown when the undumpable fuel specified in NOTE 9 is included in the landing weight. 
 (Models shown in parenthesis( ) are the LAC designations for the specified weight category). 
 NOTE 15. (a) Model 49 main gear shock struts listed as Equipment Items 200(a) or (c), if modified in accordance with LAC 
 Service Bulletin 49/SB-66, are also eligible for use on model 149 aircraft. These modified struts are 
 identified as Cleveland Types 8298BA. 
 (b) Model 49 nose gear shock struts, listed as Equipment Items 201(a), (b), (c), (d), or (e), if modified in 
 accordance with LAC Service Bulletin 49/SB-66, are also eligible for use on model 149 aircraft. These 
 modified struts are identified as Cleveland types 8297BA, 8297BC, 8297CA, 8297DA or 8297FA. 
 NOTE 16. (a) Model 749 aircraft are also eligible for certification with installation of large cargo door described by 
 LAC Drawing No. 299984. 
 (b) Military Models VC121-B and C-121A are essentially identical to model 749 aircraft modified in 
 accordance with (a) above and are eligible for civil certification with the following stipulations: 
 (1) The manufacturer's nameplate on the airplane should be altered to show the date of conversion and 
 the designation ""Model 749-79."" 
 (2) Life rafts installed in the vicinity of the navigator's station must be removed or relocated to eliminate 
 the interference with the emergency exit in that vicinity. 
 (3) Each airplane should be inspected for possible hidden damage, satisfactory workmanship and materials 
 utilized in making repairs and/or alterations, compliance with applicable Airworthiness Directive Notes, 
 installation of approved equipment (see NOTE 1), and for additions or changes accomplished subsequent 
 to delivery which may adversely affect the operation as a civil aircraft. 
 NOTE 17. The conversion of Model 749 aircraft to Model 749A is covered by LAC Service Bulletins 49/SB-500, -500A and 
 -545. Since production changes similar to the modifications described in Bulletin 49/SB-500 were incorporated in 
 serial Nos. 2589, 2590, 2601 and subsequent prior to their delivery from the factory these aircraft are eligible for 
 certification and Model 749 at maximum landing and take-off weights of 86,500 lbs. and 102,000 lbs., 
 respectively. The landing weight may be increased to 89,500 lbs. when provisions of Service Bulletin 49/SB-545 
 are incorporated
