l,"Inspect the leading edges of all wings by removing the nacelle cowling forward of the front spar and the inspection 
 plate from the rib on the first nose rib assembly outboard of the nacelle. If the rib spacing in the leading edge is 
 approximately 4 inches the wing is satisfactory. If the rib spacing is approximately 8 inches the wing must be 
 modified in accordance with Cessna Service Bulletins No. 40 dated February 24, 1943, and No. 48 dated 
 August 20, 1943, revised May 1, 1944."
a,"In order to determine whether the airplane is eligible for certification at a maximum weight in excess of 
 5,100 lbs., the wings can be identified by the following salient features: 
 (1) 
 5,700 lb. wings have a laminated (8 to 10-ply) birch plywood reinforcement on the rear face of the rear 
 spar (instead of a spruce block found on the 5,100 lb. wing) extending continuously through the center 
 section from nacelle to nacelle. Ends of this plywood plate are scarfed out just inboard of each nacelle 
 bearing block. 
 (2) 
 Continuous plywood flanges 1 to 1 1/2 x 1/16 inch are found on both sides of the lower cap strip of wing 
 ribs between the front and rear spar on 5,700 lb. wings. 
 (3) 
 The diagonal in the nose ribs of the 5,700 lb. wing is 5/16 x 7/16 instead of 5/16 x 5/16 found in the 
 5,100 lb. wing."
b,"Wings identified by the above specifications are wing assemblies No. 55700 and when installed, the airplane 
 may be certificated at a maximum weight of 5,400 or 5,700 lbs. depending upon the items installed as 
 specified under ""Maximum Weight"" on Page 1 of this specification."
c,"Wings with the rear spar and reinforcing plate on the rear face made of spruce block only are wing assemblies 
 No. T-50100 or 53600. These are not eligible for weights in excess of 5,100 lb."
d,"When the airplane is certificated the 1/2 inch red letters immediately forward of the Army markings on the 
 trailing edge of the wing which read ""Max. gross weight 5,200 lb."" or ""5,300 lb."" or ""5,700 lb."" should be 
 removed from the wing."
"NOTE 4. 
 Model T-50 (also exported RCAF T-50) airplanes having wing leading edges modified in accordance with Cessna",
