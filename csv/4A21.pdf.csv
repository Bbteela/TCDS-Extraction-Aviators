CG range and Datum,"The nose gear retraction moment is 18,600 in.-lb. and moves C.G. forward. 
 The main gear retracts parallel to the Wing Reference Axis; hence, 
 has no effect on airplane C.G. 
 All stations noted in the Data Sheet are Body Stations unless 
 identified specifically as moment arms. Dwg. 69-10819 defines Body Stations and 
 moment arms. Datum is 50 in. forward of nose (moment arm = 0) for weight and 
 balance purposes. Horizontal distance of datum to average wing jack point is 
 810.5 in.

 surfaces must be carefully controlled by proper rigging of the flight control systems. 
 The airplane must, therefore, be rigged in accordance with the following FAA

Production basis,Production Certificate No. 700
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. Boeing 
 Airplane Company Document D6-5694 contains lists of all required equipment for 
 Model 707-100 Long Body, and 707-200. The required equipment that must be 
 installed as well as optional equipment approved for 707-100B Long Body and 
 707-100B Short Body are listed in Boeing Documents D6-1840 and D6-3021 respectively. 
 The Weight and Balance Manual Documents indicated for each model under ""Fuel 
 Capacity"" contain lists of equipment as well as optional installations approved by the FAA."
NOTE 1,"(a) 
 Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and loading 
 instructions must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter except in the 
 case of the operators having an approved weight control system. 
 (b) 
 The airplane must be loaded so the C.G. is within the specified limits at all times, with the effects of fuel and 
 water use, the movement of crew and passengers from their assigned positions being considered. 
 (c) 
 The ""drainable unusable fuel"" is that amount of fuel in the tanks which is unavailable to the engines under 
 critical flight conditions as defined in CAR 4b.416. This drainable unusable fuel does not include the ""tank 
 trapped fuel"" or ""line unusable fuel"", which is the unusable fuel retrained in the fuel feed and fuel dump lines. 
 The ""total unusable fuel"", which includes the drainable unusable fuel, tank trapped fuel and line unusable fuel, 
 must be included in the airplane empty weight or be suitably accounted for in the airplane weight and balance 
 report. The total amount of fuel is as follows: 
 For Model 707-100 Long Body except for the 707-124 version: 
 Tank Trapped fuel 
 10.71 gal

 I. Model 707-100 Long Body and Model 707-200 
 Fuel capacity and usage procedure are dictated by structural design. To preserve favorable wing 
 bending moments, the following limitations shall apply: 
 All center section fuel in excess of any included in the zero fuel weight must be used before the transfer 
 of outboard reserve fuel. 
 The airplane gross weight must not exceed 233,000 lb. if the reserve tanks are empty."
A,"Fuel Loading Limitations 
 1. 
 Load main tanks 1, 2, 3, and 4 equally. 
 2. 
 If main tanks are full, load reserve tanks. 
 3. 
 If all main and reserve tanks are full and additional fuel is required, load center tank to required fuel quantity. 
 NOTE: 
 Center tank fuel may be substituted for payload in any quantity up to the maximum allowable payload* or to 
 the center wing tank capacity, whichever is lower, provided the difference in effect on balance is also 
 accounted for. 
 NOTE: 
 Tanks selected for fuel may be loaded simultaneously. 
 *Maximum Zero Fuel Weight less airplane basic operating weight."
B Fuel Usage Limitations,"Use tank to engine combination during all takeoffs and landings, except as noted under Minimum Fuel Go-Around."
See Airplane Flight Manual,"Center tank fuel in excess of any included in the Zero Fuel Weight must be used after a minimum of 5,000 lb. up to 
 a maximum of 10,000 lb. (total) of main tank fuel has been expended for takeoff and climb to altitude. 
 Do not initiate the transfer of reserve tank fuel until the fuel quantity in each outboard main tank is less than 12,000 lb."
II. Model 707-100B Long Body and 707-100B Short Body:,
the transfer of outboard fuel,"The airplane gross weight must not exceed 243,000 lb. if the reserve tanks are empty."
1,"(Applicable to 707-100B Short Body; 707-131B; 707-121B; and 707-139B) Load center tank fuel to 10,000 lb. 
 This limitation is applicable only when the total fuel load is less than 80,000 lb. and the reserve tanks are loaded 
 and the zero fuel weight C.G. is aft of 27% MAC."
2,"Load Main tanks 1, 2, 3, and 4 equally."
3,"If main tanks are full, load reserve tanks."
4,"If all main and reserve tanks are full and additional fuel is required, load center tank to required fuel quantity. 
 NOTE: 
 Center tank may be substituted for payload in any quantity up to the maximum allowable payload* 
 and 10,000 lb. or to the center wing tank capacity, whichever is lower, provided the difference 
 in effect on balance is also accounted for. When the takeoff C.G. is expected to be in the aft 
 takeoff restricted zone, load up to 15,000 lbs. of center tank fuel before loading main tanks to achieve 
 a more forward C.G. 
 NOTE: 
 Tanks selected for fuel may be loaded simultaneously. 
 *Maximum Zero Fuel Weight less airplane basic operating weight."
B Fuel Usage Limitations,"Use tank to engine combination during all takeoffs and landings, except as noted under Minimum Fuel Go-Around."
See Airplane Flight Manual,"Center tank fuel in excess of any included in the effective structural design zero fuel weight must be used after a minimum 
 of 5,000 lb. up to a maximum of 10,000 lb. (total) of main tank fuel has been expended for takeoff and climb to altitude. 
 Do not initiate the transfer of reserve tank fuel until the fuel quantity in each outboard main tank is less than 12,000 lb. 
 Fuel reserves must be retained in main tanks only."

 Assembly""."
NOTE 4,"Aft of Fuselage Station 850, the airplane design vertical load factors exceed TSO C-39 specifications; 
 therefore, replacement passenger seats aft of Fuselage Station 850 must be evaluated for compliance with 4b.358(c)."

NOTE 7,"(a) and (b) below apply to Model 707-200 only; (c) applies to Model 707-100 Long Body: 
 (a) 
 The oil tank capacity (8.3 gal.) as required per CAR 4b.440(b), is based on a maximum engine oil 
 consumption of 0.4 gal. per hour. Any increase in engine oil consumption above this rate will 
 reduce the operating range of the airplane. 
 (b) 
 Using the Bullseye or Sight Gage as a level for servicing the oil tank will result in a lesser oil quantity 
 and will reduce the operating range of the airplane. 
 (c) 
 The takeoff thrust rating for this engine may be increased to 13,500 lb. when Boeing Service Bulletin 
 No. 538 has been complied with and the appropriate Airplane Flight Manual information is provided."

 or mixed in any proportions without adversely affecting the engine operation or power output. No fuel 
 control adjustment is required when switching fuel types. 
 Phillips anti-icing fuel additive PFA-55MB (MIL-I-27686 USAF) may be used if concentration delivered to airplane 
 does not exceed 0.1% by volume. No fuel system anti-icing credit is allowed. 
 Anti-static fuel additive (Shell ASA-3) may be mixed with the fuel (recommended quantity 0.5 to 1.0 ppm) 
 provided the effective conductivity of the mixture does not exceed 300 picomhos per meter."
