"VIII - Model GIV-X (Transport Category), Approved August 12, 2004 
 The Gulfstream GIV-X is the same as the Gulfstream GIV except for the following differences: 
  
 A Honeywell advanced flight deck display suite (common with the GV-SP) to improve flight crew situational 
 awareness and operational capabilities 
  
 Airframe nose common with the GV-SP 
  
 Airframe aerodynamic improvements and engine improvements for increased range and payload 
  
 Cabin main entry door relocated aft and fuselage 12 inch extension incorporated 
  
 Tay 611 engine replaced with derivative Tay 611-8C. Added engine FADEC 
  
 Redesigned thrust reverser, nacelle and pylon 
  
 System improvements 
 - 
 Electrical power generation (common with GV-SP) 
 - 
 Dual digital cabin temperature control and pressurization (common with GV-SP) 
 - 
 Nose landing gear (common with GV-SP) 
 - 
 Replaced APU with Honeywell 36-150 APU 
 - 
 Redesigned flap/stab actuation system with digital control 
 - 
 Redesigned main landing gear wheels and brakes 
 - 
 Added flight control system hard-over protection system 
 NOTE: There are two variants of the GIV-X (see Note 8): (1) The G450, which is identical to the GIV-X, and (2) the G350, 
 which has a reduced fuel capacity.",

 NOTE: The high altitude special condition includes pressurization system requirements, as 
 well as damage tolerance requirements on the pressure vessel. Therefore, any changes to the 
 pressurization system or modifications or repairs to the pressure vessel must be approved in 
 accordance with the requirements defined in the special condition. 
 The damage tolerance requirements in the special condition are specified in terms of cabin 
 altitude time history, which is a function of the cabin leak rate. The specified cabin altitude 
 time history requirement can be met with a pressure vessel opening of 7.2 square inches 
 effective area (which considers the appropriate discharge coefficient assuming an emergency 
 descent). The determination of an equivalent crack length will depend upon the particular 
 location of the crack, the pressure vessel configuration in that location, the direction of the 
 crack, etc. The approval of modifications and/or repairs must take into account the 
 requirements of the special condition and how they apply to the particular location and 
 configuration being modified or required. The resulting inspection program must also 
 consider other applicable structural criteria.

NOTE 9,"Cockpit Field of View: 
 The cockpit front windshield dimensions for the Models G-1159, G-1159A, G-1159B, G-IV, G-V, 
 GV-SP, and GIV-X airplanes are critical for forward field of view certification requirements; therefore, no 
 equipment should be installed on top of the glare shield without prior coordination with an FAA Aircraft 
 Certification Office."
NOTE 10,"Model G-1159A, S/N 249, 313 and 330: 
 The equipment listed in Gulfstream American Report No. 1159A-GER-78, ""Royal Danish Air

NOTE 11,"Systems Modifications: 
 The G-IV, GV, GV-SP and GIV-X models incorporate integrated avionics systems using software-based line 
 replaceable units (LRU’s) which share a digital signal transmission bus. The avionics configuration of the 
 G-IV, GV, GV-SP and GIV-X as delivered from production, is critical to the proper operation of the cockpit 
 instrumentation system. Modification to the LRU software supplied with the G-IV, GV, GV-SP or GIV-X, 
 replacement of an LRU with a different LRU, addition of new LRU, or alteration of an LRU interface could 
 adversely affect the airworthiness of the certified product. Accordingly, no changes to the integrated avionics 
 system should be made without coordination with the Aircraft Certification Office having jurisdiction over 
 the modifier."
NOTE 12,"Cockpit Modifications: 
 Any modification or changes in cockpit configuration which may affect aircrew workload, cockpit 
 noise level or day/night lighting must be evaluated by an FAA Aircraft Certification Flight Test 
 Pilot or Flight Standards Operation Inspector."

NOTE 16,"G-II Aging Aircraft Program 
 As part of the G-II Aging Aircraft Program, an Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS) is being added to

 being developed in order to provide the corresponding inspection procedures and methods. The ALS and 
 SSID are being developed to FAR 25.571 at Amendment 25-54, based on the damage tolerance requirements 
 of AC91-56A. Through the damage tolerance requirements, the ALS and SSID will remove certain life 
 limitations on previous safe life certified components. With the incorporation of the ALS and SSID, the G-II 
 airframe Extended Service Goal (ESG) will be 40,000 flight hours and 36,000 flights."

NOTE 20,"Cockpit Video Display: 
 The avionics architecture of the GV-SP and GIV-X models includes a capability to display multiple, assorted 
 video inputs on the cockpit display units positioned directly in front of the pilots. Because these displays 
 affect crew workload, changes to the approved video input sources (including the addition of new video 
 sources or capabilities) will require a specific FAA approval, including specific acknowledgement and 
 concurrence from an FAA Aircraft Certification Office."

 takeoff, and landing on the GII, GIII, and GIV if verified by the installing STC or other FAA approved data. 
 In flight use of the jump seat in any Gulfstream model also requires that related articles, specifically an FAA
