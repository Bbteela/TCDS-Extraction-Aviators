Required Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations (see Certification 
 Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. The British Aircraft Corporation’s BAC 1-11 
 Illustrated Parts Catalogue contains lists of all required equipment as well as optional equipment 
 installations approved by the Civil Aviation Authority. 
 Refer Publication IPC/BAC 1-11 for each aircraft type."
DATA PERTINENT TO ALL MODELS,
Datum,"The center of gravity datum (Stn. 0) is 4.0 in. forward of the nose and 50.7 in. forward of the weighing 
 reference point, the latter being marked on a plate on the under-surface of the fuselage on the center line

 The CAA originally type certificated this aircraft under its type certificate number BA3. The FAA validated 
 this product under U.S. Type Certificate Number A5EU. On September 28, 2003, the European 
 Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this product on behalf of the CAA. 
 In EASA Certification Information No. 2010-01 dated February 12, 2010, EASA accepted AIRBUS' request 
 for surrender and revoked EASA Type Certificate A.188 for the British Aerospace BAC One Eleven, Series 
 200, 300, 400, 500, and 475. 
 Airbus has also requested that the FAA accept their surrender of the corresponding FAA import type 
 certificate, in letter reference BA00D10027369, dated October 11, 2010. 
 FAA Aircraft Engineering Division, Certification Policy and Procedures Branch AIR-110 is developing a 
 policy for import product surrendered certificates, including continued operational safety support for such 
 products. For further information contact AIR-110, at telephone number 202-385-631."
Import Requirements,"A U.S. Airworthiness Certificate may be issued on the basis of a United Kingdom Certificate of 
 Airworthiness for Export signed by a representative of the Civil Aviation Department, Board of 
 Trade, containing the following statement: “The airplane covered by this certificate has been found 
 to comply with the British Civil Airworthiness Requirements (1st November 1963), the Special 
 Conditions notified by the United States Government to the Government of the United Kingdom 
 including V.A. Note 1, Issue 1, and conforms to Type Certificate No. A5EU.” 
 The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an CAA Export Certificate of 
 Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the CAA on behalf of the European 
 Community. The Export C of A should contain the following statement: ‘The aircraft covered by this 
 certificate has been examined, tested, and found to conform to the type design approved under U.S. 
 Type Certificate No A5EU and to be in a condition for safe operation.’ 
 FAA Aircraft Engineering Division, Certification Policy and Procedures Branch AIR-110 is developing 
 a policy for import product surrendered certificates, that will affect eligibility for import. For further
