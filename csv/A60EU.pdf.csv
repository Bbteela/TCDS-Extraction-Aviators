 Direction Générale de l’Aviation Civile (DGAC) originally type certified this aircraft under its 
 type certificate number TC 181, and EASA Type Certificate Number EASA.A.010. The FAA 
 validated this product under U.S. Type Certificate Number A60EU. Effective September 28, 
 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this product on behalf 
 of France."
Import Requirements,"a) To be considered eligible for operation in the United States, each aircraft manufactured 
 under this type certificate must be accompanied by a certificate of airworthiness for 
 export or certifying statement endorsed by the exporting foreign civil airworthiness 
 authority which states (in the English language): This aircraft conforms to its U.S. type 
 design (type certificate number A60EU) and is in a condition for safe operation. 
 b) The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR 
 Section 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR Sections 21.183 (c) 
 or 21.185(c). 
 c) The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR 
 Section 21.29 exported from countries other than the country of manufacture (e.g., third 
 party country) is FAR Section 21.183(d) or 21.183(b). 
 The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export Certificate of 
 Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the Direction Générale de 
 l’Aviation Civile (DGAC) on behalf of the European Community. The Export C of A 
 should contain the following statement: ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been 
 examined, tested, and found to comply with U.S. airworthiness regulations 14 CFR 23 
 approved under U.S. Type Certificate No. A60EU and to be in a condition for safe 
 operation.’ 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness (or 
 equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification 
 of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported 
 aircraft."
