 Production basis 
 Production Certificate No. 423WE, Spare Parts Only 
 Equipment 
 The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable air worthiness regulations 
 (See Certification Basis) must be installed in the helicopter for certification. Hiller 
 Report 63-109, ""Model UH-12L Master Equipment List"", and Report 63-108, ""Model 
 UH-12L4 Master Equipment List"", contain a list of all required equipment that must be 
 installed as well as optional equipment installations approved by the FAA. 
 NOTES 
 NOTE 1 
 Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and 
 loading instructions, must be provided for each helicopter at the time of original certification. Ballast, when 
 necessary, must be carried in accordance with Loading Instructions in the FAA Approved Rotorcraft Flight 
 Manual. 
 Fuel capacity as indicated is total tank capacity over and above ""Unusable Fuel"". The fuel tank capacity 
 includes ""Unusable"" fuel of 0.3 gallon, Model UH-12L and 3.2 gallons, Model UH-12L4, which cannot be 
 used safely in all flight attitudes, and which must be included in the empty weight. 
 NOTE 2 
 The following placard must be installed on the Pilot's Checklist: 
 ""This Helicopter must be operated in compliance with the operating limitations specified in the FAA 
 Approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual."" 
 For additional placards, see the FAA Approved Rotorcraft Flight manual.

 NOTE 4 
 These Helicopters must be serviced and maintained in conformance with instructions given by Fairchild 
 Hiller Corporation, in the pertinent model inspection guide, repair handbook, and service and overhaul 
 manuals. 
 NOTE 5 
 Model UH-12E Helicopters (3 and 4 place configurations) may be converted to Model UH-12L or UH-12L4 
 by accomplishment of Hiller Service Bulletins No. 2040 (Dwg. 10060) or No. 2045 (Dwg. 10059) 
 respectively. 
 NOTE 6 
 The type certificate holder has demonstrated compliance with FAR 133.43 for the UH-12L and UH-12L4 
 Helicopters for Class B (Jettisonable Sling Load) Rotorcraft - load combination at a maximum overall weight 
 of 3500 pounds and a maximum sling load of 1000 pounds, when modified to incorporate cargo hook 
 installation per Hiller Dwg. 91012-23 (UH-12L4) and 91012-25 (UH-12L). The helicopter weight without 
 sling load is not to exceed certificated weight of 3100 pounds. For limitations see pertinent FAA Approved 
 Rotorcraft Flight Manual Revision and Rotorcraft - Load Combination Flight Manual to be submitted by 
 applicant for external load operator's certificate in accordance with FAR part 133. 
 NOTE 7 
 Certain part numbers used on this model helicopter may be used on other model helicopters in 
 which their use is life limited. These part numbers are listed in TCDS 4H11, H1WE, 4H10, 6H1, 
 and 6H2 and FAA approved Hiller Instructions for Continued Airworthiness. If a full and 
 complete service history from manufacture forward is not available that demonstrates these parts 
 were used only on a model helicopter for which the part is not life limited then those parts shall be 
 life limited to the lowest number of hours given in those TCDS’s or ICAs. If a full and complete 
 service history from the manufacturer forward is available, and any operating time has occurred in 
 a life limited model helicopter, that part shall be considered life limited at the lowest life limit 
 listed even if transferred and used on a helicopter model for which it is not life limited. Only those 
 parts for which a full and complete service history from manufacture forward is available and 
 which shows only operating time on a helicopter model for which it is not life limited are 
 considered not life limited.",
