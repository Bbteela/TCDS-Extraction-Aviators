Serial Nos eligible,"The United Kingdom Certificate for Airworthiness for Export endorsed 
 as noted under ""Certification basis"" must be submitted for each individual 
 aircraft for which application for certification is made."
Certification basis,"CAR 10. Type Certificate No. 7A7 issued November 11, 1959. 
 Date of Application for Type Certificate October 26, 1955. 
 The CAA originally type certificated this aircraft under its type certificate. The FAA 
 validated this product under U.S. Type Certificate Number 7A7. Effective September 28, 
 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this product on 
 behalf of the CAA. 
 Each aircraft and any replacement parts manufactured in the United Kingdom 
 must be designated as ""import"" and clearly labeled as such in accordance with 
 CAR 10.30. 
 The U.S. Airworthiness Certificate may be issued on the basis of a United 
 Kingdom Certificate of Airworthiness for Export signed by a representative of 
 the Ministry of Aviation containing the following notation: ""The aeroplane covered 
 by this certificate has been examined and found to comply with British Airworthiness 
 Requirements (1951) and the Special Requirements for Twin Pioneer Series 2 and Series 
 3 notified by the U.S.A. Government to the Government of the United Kingdom 
 and conforms to T.C. 7A7."" (This certification equivalent to CAR 4b amended to 
 December 31, 1953, plus amendments 4b-1, 4b-2 and 4b-4.) 
 The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an CAA Export Certificate of 
 Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the CAA on behalf of the 
 European Community. The Export C of A should contain the following statement: ‘The 
 aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to conform to the 
 type design approved under U.S. Type Certificate No 7A7 and to be in a condition for safe 
 operation.’"
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. Approved 
 equipment is shown in Scottish Aviation Equipment List No. TP/2/1 for Series 2 aircraft 
 and in Equipment List No. TP/3/1 for Series 3 aircraft. In addition, the following items 
 of equipment are required: 
 (a) Engine Power Failure Warning System. 
 (b) ""Unusable Fuel and System Oil"" and all hydraulic fluid must be included in the certificated empty weight. 
 Unusable fuel is that quantity of fuel in the system and in the tanks which is unavailable to the engine 
 under critical flight conditions as defined in CAR 4b.416. This unusable fuel includes ""system fuel"" which 
 is defined as the quantity required to fill the system and tanks to the tank outlet level when the airplane is 
 in the ground level attitude. The fuel gauges are calibrated with the unusable fuel level as the zero datum. 
 The total amount of fuel is as follows: 
 Usable fuel 
 Unusable fuel"
Series 2,"@ 6.0 lb./U.S. gal. 
 @ 6.0 lb./U.S. gal. 
 290 U.S. gal. 
 6 U.S. gal. 
 Usable fuel 
 Unusable fuel"
Series 3,"@ 6.0 lb./U.S. gal. 
 @ 6.0 lb./U.S. gal. 
 434 U.S. gal. 
 10 U.S. gal. 
 System Oil is that amount of oil required to fill the oil system and tanks to the tank outlets to the engines. 
 The propeller feathering oil is not considered usable oil and is included in ""System Oil"". System oil weight 
 is 36 lb. The oil tank capacities shown in this data sheet include only the usable oil for which the tanks 
 are placarded. Dipstick readings indicate the amount of usable oil."
