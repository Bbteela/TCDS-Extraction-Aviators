Note 5,"Lycoming Model T5309B, T5309C, and T5311A engines are eligible at the same ratings and limitations as 
 the Model T5309A engine in Model 204B helicopters equipped with P/N 204-060-494-1 orifice installed in 
 the oil cooler bleed air system in accordance with Bell Service Instruction No. 204-10. Fuel, per MIL-J- 
 5624, Grade JP-5 is eligible in Model 204B helicopters equipped with Model T5309C and T5311A engines. 
 See Note 21. 
 this value is required on each engine and the value corresponding to takeoff power is stamped on the engine 
 data plate. To assure correct interpretation of this value on the aircraft torquemeter, the torquemeter must be 
 adjusted so that the value of 47.5 (for the Model 204B and 205A); 54.0 (for the Model 205A-1) or 55.7 (for 
 the Model 205B) on the torquemeter plastic overlay corresponds to the engine data plate torque pressure. 
 Specific instructions for this adjustment are included in the applicable Rotorcraft Flight Manual. 
 For the Model 210, the engine calibration factor is the torquemeter oil pressure corresponding to 875 ft-lbs. 
 To assure correct interpretation of this value on the aircraft torque indicating system, the torque indicator 
 must be calibrated so that the takeoff limit (100% torque) is equal to 1026.5 ft-lbs. Actual torquemeter 
 pressure at takeoff power will vary depending upon engine calibration factor. Specific instructions for the 
 torque indicator calibration are included in the aircraft maintenance manual."
Note 7,"Gas producer speed as shown under ""Engine Limits"" are maximum permissible speeds. The gas producer 
 speed for rated power output varies with individual engines and must be determined during engine 
 calibration and installed on the instrument panel must correspond to the engine data plate gas producer 
 speed. For Models 204B, 205A, and 205A-1 helicopters, the engine gas producer speed limits also vary with 
 OAT in accordance with the schedule as shown on the Temperature Limit placard on the instrument panel."
Note 8,"For the models 204B, 205A, 205A-1 and 205B the maximum permissible exhaust gas temperature varies 
 with ambient temperature as described in the Rotorcraft Flight Manual and on the face of the ambient 
 temperature gage on the instrument panel."
Note 9,"Phillips PFA55MB anti-icing additive at a concentration not in excess of 0.1% by volume may be used in 
 fuel for the Model 204B helicopter. No fuel system anti-icing credit is allowed."
Note 10,"The engine air induction system has been substantiated for icing characteristics as necessary to demonstrate 
 that ice accumulation on the engine air inlet will not adversely affect engine operation or cause a serious loss 
 of power when the helicopter is operated in icing conditions within the capability of the remainder of the 
 helicopter to operate under such conditions."
