 WARNING: To prevent unsafe airplane handling characteristics, PW4000 series engines with electronic 
 Engine control (EEC) part number 791100-14-102 (Pratt & Whitney part number 54D043) must not be 
 installed on the same airplane as PW4000 series engines that have the ring case compressor configuration. 
 This combination of engine configurations is not approved because of a significant difference in engine 
 acceleration rates and the effect of that difference on airplane handling characteristics. Ring case compressor 
 equipped engines were approved with the same engine model number as previously approved PW4000 
 configurations, and must be identified by the presence of a “/A5” marked at the end of the “INSTL ARR”

 14 CFR 25.1329 – Flight Guidance System 
 The following design features must be incorporated in the type design (reference § 25.1329, Amendment 25-46). In lieu of the following, 
 compliance to 25.1329, Amendment 25-119, may be shown."
1,"Quick autopilot disconnect switches for each pilot on the outboard arm of each control wheel and quick autothrust disconnect 
 switches for each pilot on the underside of the thrust control levers for engines 1 and 4."
2,"Positive disconnect function for the autopilot is provided by the disconnect bar located at the glare shield on the autopilot mode 
 control panel (MCP)."
3,"Positive disconnect function for the autothrottle is provided by the autothrottle arm switch, also located on the MCP."
4,"Automatic synchronization of the autopilot and autothrust functions is provided in order to ensure transient free engagement and 
 mode switching."
5,Automatic stabilizer trim is used to offload the elevator in order to ensure transient free disengagement of the autopilot pitch axis.
6,"The wheel position provides a visual and tactile indication of any wheel input which may be required at disengagement of the 
 autopilot roll axis."
7,"When multiple autopilot channels are engaged, disengagement of an individual autopilot does not result in a transient any greater 
 than a minor transient."
8,The throttle levers remain in the current position when the autothrust function is disengaged.
9,"Failures of the automatic stabilizer trim function, and other detected failures which degrade autopilot operation but do not pose an 
 immediate hazard to the airplane, result in activation of the master caution light and aural, as well as the display of an 
 AUTOPILOT caution message. 
 10. Detected failures which do pose an immediate hazard to the airplane, result in an autopilot disconnect with associated autopilot 
 disconnect warning level annunciation that includes activation of the master warning light and aural as well as the display of an 
 AUTOPILOT warning message. 
 11. Transition from multiple autopilot operation to single autopilot operation (with associated yaw axis autopilot servo disconnect), 
 during engine inoperative go-around, does not require exceptional piloting skill, alertness, or strength. 
 12. The AFDS provides low speed protection via the following features: 
 a. 
 The AFDS controls to an angle-of-attack which corresponds to one degree below the stick shaker angle-of-attack. 
 b. The AFDS take-off mode provides windshear recovery guidance which meets the criteria of AC 25-12 and AC 120-41. 
 c. 
 An indication to the flight crew of a low speed condition includes the display of the stick shaker angle-of-attack via a pitch 
 limit indicator (PLI). 
 d. The thrust management function (TMF), when engaged in SPD mode, provides low speed protection when the AFDS 
 vertical speed (V/S) mode is engaged and commanding a climb. In addition, if the angle-of-attack rises above a fixed 
 reference point, the AFDS issues a V/S mode failure by removing the pitch flight director bars if the flight director is turned 
 on. 
 e. 
 If the autopilot is engaged, a V/S mode failure will result in an amber line being drawn through the V/S mode annunciation 
 on the primary flight display (PFD), illumination of the master caution light, activation of the master caution aural, and 
 display of an AUTOPILOT caution message. 
 f. 
 An indication to the flight crew of a low speed condition is an AIRSPEED LOW caution message when the airspeed drops 
 below the top of the lower amber band of the airspeed indicator. 
 g. 
 The AFDS provides low speed protection by controlling to a reference angle-of-attack when in Flight Level Change (FLCH) 
 mode. An additional indication to the flight crew of a low speed condition is an AIRSPEED LOW caution message when 
 the airspeed drops below the top of the lower amber band. 
 h. 
 When the AFDS altitude capture (ALT CAP) mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides low speed 
 protection. In addition, under certain conditions the AFDS will provide altitude capture speed floor protection by 
 controlling to a speed no lower than 5 knots below the MCP selected speed. 
 i. 
 If the AFDS altitude capture mode is engaged, and the angle-of-attack rises above a fixed reference point the AFDS will 
 issue an ALT CAP mode failure by removing the pitch flight director bars if the flight director is turned on. If the autopilot 
 is engaged, the ALT CAP mode failure will result in a mode annunciation on the Primary Flight Display (PFD), illumination 
 of the master caution light, activation of the master caution aural, and display of an AUTOPILOT caution message. An 
 additional indication to the flight crew of a low speed condition is an AIRSPEED LOW caution message when the airspeed 
 drops below the top of the lower amber band. 
 j. 
 When the AFDS Altitude Hold (ALT HLD) mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides low speed 
 protection. An additional indication to the flight crew of a low speed condition is an AIRSPEED LOW caution message 
 when the airspeed drops below the top of the lower amber band. 
 k. 
 When the AFDS Vertical Navigation (VNAV) mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides low speed 
 protection. Otherwise, when engaged in VNAV SPD, the FMF provides low speed protection. An additional indication to 
 the flight crew of a low speed condition is an AIRSPEED LOW caution message when the airspeed drops below the top of 
 the lower amber band. 
 l. 
 When the AFDS glideslope (G/S) mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides low speed protection. An 
 additional indication to the flight crew of a low speed condition is an AIRSPEED LOW caution message when the airspeed 
 drops below the top of the lower amber band. 
 m. When the AFDS go-around mode is engaged, the AFDS provides low speed protection by controlling to an angle-of-attack 
 which corresponds to one degree below the stick shaker angle-of-attack. The AFDS go-around mode provides windshear 
 recovery guidance and meets the criteria of AC 25-12 and AC 120-41. An additional indication to the flight crew of a low 
 speed condition includes the display of the stick shaker angle-of-attack (via a pitch limit indicator (PLI)). 
 n. 
 Autothrottle wake-up requires that the autothrottle arm switch, located on the MCP, be in the ARM position. When the 
 AFDS in not in takeoff, go-around, FLCH, or VNAV SPD modes, the autothrottle will automatically engage into SPD mode 
 and provide speed protection when the airspeed drops approximately 5 to 10 knots below the top of the lower amber band. 
 13. The AFDS provides high speed protection via the following features: 
 o. Indication to the flight crew of a high speed condition is an OVERSPEED warning message when the airspeed/Mach 
 number exceeds VMO/MMO 
 p. When the AFDS takeoff mode is engaged, the AFDS provides high speed protection by controlling to the flap placard (flaps 
 down) or VMO/MMO (flaps up). 
 q. When the AFDS V/S mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides high speed protection. 
 r. 
 When the AFDS FLCH mode in engaged, the AFDS provides high speed protection by controlling to the flap placard (flaps 
 down) or VMO/MMO (flaps up). 
 s. 
 When the AFDS ALT CAP mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides high speed protection. 
 t. 
 When the AFDS ALT HLD mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides high speed protection. 
 u. When the AFDS VNAV mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides high speed protection. Otherwise, 
 when engaged in VNAV SPD, the FMF provides high speed protection. 
 v. When the AFDS G/S mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides high speed protection. 
 w. When the AFDS go-Around mode is engaged, the AFDS provides high speed protection by controlling to the flap placard 
 (flaps down) or VMO/MMO (flaps up). 
 operation as well as any armed modes. Mode transitions are indicated on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) and highlighted with 
 boxes that are displayed around the changed mode for ten seconds following the mode change. The indications are visible to 
 each pilot under all expected lighting conditions during the flight deck lighting evaluation. 
 15. Autopilot disengagement is annunciated via illumination of the master warning light, activation of the master warning aural, and 
 via the display of an AUTOPILOT warning message. A dedicated autopilot warning provides for an aural warning which is 
 unique from all of the other aural warnings. 
 16. Override of the Autothrust by the flight crew using the throttles does not require excessive force, and does not create a potential 
 hazard to the airplane.

 14 CFR 25.1329 – Flight Guidance System 
 The following design features must be incorporated in the type design (reference § 25.1329, Amendment 25-46). In lieu of the 
 following, compliance to 25.1329, Amendment 25-119, may be shown."
1,"Quick autopilot disconnect switches for each pilot on the outboard arm of each control wheel and quick autothrust disconnect 
 switches for each pilot on the underside of the thrust control levers for engines 1 and 4."
2,"Positive disconnect function for the autopilot is provided by the disconnect bar located at the glare shield on the autopilot mode 
 control panel (MCP)."
3,"Positive disconnect function for the autothrottle is provided by the autothrottle arm switch, also located on the MCP."
4,"Automatic synchronization of the autopilot and autothrust functions is provided in order to ensure transient free engagement and 
 mode switching."
5,Automatic stabilizer trim is used to offload the elevator in order to ensure transient free disengagement of the autopilot pitch axis.
6,"The wheel position provides a visual and tactile indication of any wheel input which may be required at disengagement of the 
 autopilot roll axis."
7,"When multiple autopilot channels are engaged, disengagement of an individual autopilot does not result in a transient any greater 
 than a minor transient."
8,The throttle levers remain in the current position when the autothrust function is disengaged.
9,"Failures of the automatic stabilizer trim function, and other detected failures which degrade autopilot operation but do not pose an 
 immediate hazard to the airplane, result in activation of the master caution light and aural, as well as the display of an 
 AUTOPILOT caution message. 
 10. Detected failures which do pose an immediate hazard to the airplane, result in an autopilot disconnect with associated autopilot 
 disconnect warning level annunciation that includes activation of the master warning light and aural as well as the display of an 
 AUTOPILOT warning message. 
 11. Transition from multiple autopilot operation to single autopilot operation (with associated yaw axis autopilot servo disconnect), 
 during engine inoperative go-around, does not require exceptional piloting skill, alertness, or strength. 
 12. The AFDS provides low speed protection via the following features: 
 a. 
 The AFDS controls to an angle-of-attack which corresponds to one degree below the stick shaker angle-of-attack. 
 b. 
 The AFDS take-off mode provides windshear recovery guidance which meets the criteria of AC 25-12 and AC 120-41. 
 c. 
 An indication to the flight crew of a low speed condition includes the display of the stick shaker angle-of-attack via a 
 pitch limit indicator (PLI). 
 d. 
 The thrust management function (TMF), when engaged in SPD mode, provides low speed protection when the AFDS 
 vertical speed (V/S) mode is engaged and commanding a climb. In addition, if the angle-of-attack rises above a fixed 
 reference point, the AFDS issues a V/S mode failure by removing the pitch flight director bars if the flight director is 
 turned on. 
 e. 
 If the autopilot is engaged, a V/S mode failure will result in an amber line being drawn through the V/S mode 
 annunciation on the primary flight display (PFD), illumination of the master caution light, activation of the master caution 
 aural, and display of an AUTOPILOT caution message. 
 f. 
 An indication to the flight crew of a low speed condition is an AIRSPEED LOW caution message when the airspeed 
 drops below the top of the lower amber band of the airspeed indicator. 
 g. 
 The AFDS provides low speed protection by controlling to a reference angle-of-attack when in Flight Level Change 
 (FLCH) mode. An additional indication to the flight crew of a low speed condition is an AIRSPEED LOW caution 
 message when the airspeed drops below the top of the lower amber band. 
 h. 
 When the AFDS altitude capture (ALT CAP) mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides low speed 
 protection. In addition, under certain conditions the AFDS will provide altitude capture speed floor protection by 
 controlling to a speed no lower than 5 knots below the MCP selected speed. 
 i. 
 If the AFDS altitude capture mode is engaged, and the angle-of-attack rises above a fixed reference point the AFDS will 
 issue an ALT CAP mode failure by removing the pitch flight director bars if the flight director is turned on. If the 
 autopilot is engaged, the ALT CAP mode failure will result in a mode annunciation on the Primary Flight Display (PFD), 
 illumination of the master caution light, activation of the master caution aural, and display of an AUTOPILOT caution 
 message. An additional indication to the flight crew of a low speed condition is an AIRSPEED LOW caution message 
 when the airspeed drops below the top of the lower amber band. 
 j. 
 When the AFDS Altitude Hold (ALT HLD) mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides low speed 
 protection. An additional indication to the flight crew of a low speed condition is an AIRSPEED LOW caution message 
 when the airspeed drops below the top of the lower amber band. 
 k. 
 When the AFDS Vertical Navigation (VNAV) mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides low speed 
 protection. Otherwise, when engaged in VNAV SPD, the FMF provides low speed protection. An additional indication 
 to the flight crew of a low speed condition is an AIRSPEED LOW caution message when the airspeed drops below the 
 top of the lower amber band. 
 l. 
 When the AFDS glideslope (G/S) mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides low speed protection. 
 An additional indication to the flight crew of a low speed condition is an AIRSPEED LOW caution message when the 
 airspeed drops below the top of the lower amber band. 
 m. 
 When the AFDS go-around mode is engaged, the AFDS provides low speed protection by controlling to an angle-of- 
 attack which corresponds to one degree below the stick shaker angle-of-attack. The AFDS go-around mode provides 
 windshear recovery guidance and meets the criteria of AC 25-12 and AC 120-41. An additional indication to the flight 
 crew of a low speed condition includes the display of the stick shaker angle-of-attack (via a pitch limit indicator (PLI)). 
 n. 
 Autothrottle wake-up requires that the autothrottle arm switch, located on the MCP, be in the ARM position. When the 
 AFDS in not in takeoff, go-around, FLCH, or VNAV SPD modes, the autothrottle will automatically engage into SPD 
 mode and provide speed protection when the airspeed drops approximately 5 to 10 knots below the top of the lower amber 
 band. 
 13. The AFDS provides high speed protection via the following features: 
 a. 
 Indication to the flight crew of a high speed condition is an OVERSPEED warning message when the airspeed/Mach 
 number exceeds VMO/MMO 
 b. 
 When the AFDS takeoff mode is engaged, the AFDS provides high speed protection by controlling to the flap 
 placard (flaps down) or VMO/MMO (flaps up). 
 c. 
 When the AFDS V/S mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides high speed protection. 
 d. 
 When the AFDS FLCH mode in engaged, the AFDS provides high speed protection by controlling to the flap placard 
 (flaps down) or VMO/MMO (flaps up). 
 e. 
 When the AFDS ALT CAP mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides high speed protection. 
 f. 
 When the AFDS ALT HLD mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides high speed protection. 
 g. 
 When the AFDS VNAV mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides high speed protection. Otherwise, 
 when engaged in VNAV SPD, the FMF provides high speed protection. 
 h. 
 When the AFDS G/S mode is engaged, the TMF, if engaged in SPD mode, provides high speed protection. 
 i. 
 When the AFDS go-Around mode is engaged, the AFDS provides high speed protection by controlling to the flap placard 
 (flaps down) or VMO/MMO (flaps up). 
 operation as well as any armed modes. Mode transitions are indicated on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) and highlighted with 
 boxes that are displayed around the changed mode for ten seconds following the mode change. The indications are visible to 
 each pilot under all expected lighting conditions during the flight deck lighting evaluation. 
 15. Autopilot disengagement is annunciated via illumination of the master warning light, activation of the master warning aural, and 
 via the display of an AUTOPILOT warning message. A dedicated autopilot warning provides for an aural warning which is 
 unique from all of the other aural warnings. 
 16. Override of the Autothrust by the flight crew using the throttles does not require excessive force, and does not create a potential 
 hazard to the airplane. 
 Unrelated to the necessary design features itemized above, the FAA wishes to make the following clarifying statement. The FAA has 
 determined the equivalent safety finding associated with Longitudinal Trim (IP F-4) does not affect the exception granted for"
§ 251329,"14 CFR 25.365(e)(2) – Section 41 Lower Lobe (BS 140-460) 
 The following design features must be incorporated in the type design (reference § 25.365, Amendment 25-54). In lieu of incorporating the 
 following design features, compliance to § 25.365, Amendment 25-120, may be shown. 
 Section 41 Lower Lobe (BS 140-460): 
 When evaluating this compartment for compliance to § 25.365, the compartment must be analyzed using the following two conditions: 
 (1) A 3.7 square foot opening (forward EE Bay access door) with the BS 464 cargo liner intact (3.7 sf), and 
 (2) A 20.0 square foot opening with the BS 464 cargo liner blown down. This essentially combines the Section 41 Lower Lobe and 
 the forward cargo compartment into one compartment in the analysis.
