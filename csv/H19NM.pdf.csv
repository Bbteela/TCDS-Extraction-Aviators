 14 CFR part 36 as amended by Amendment 36-1 through Amendment 36-20, 
 Appendix J for initial certification at a maximum weight of 6,000 lb with P&W 
 206A engines. 
 14 CFR part 36 as amended by Amendment 36-1 through Amendment 36-21, 
 Appendix H (See Exemption No. 6505.) for certification at: 
 A maximum weight of 6,500 lb with P&W 206A engines, and 
 Maximum weights of 6,250 lb and 6,500 lb with P&W 207E engines. 
 The FAA determined that the noise characteristics of the MD900 at a maximum 
 weight of 6,250 lb with P&W 206E engines were equivalent to the 
 characteristics approved in the initial certification. 
 The FAA determined that the noise characteristics of the MD900 at a maximum 
 weight of 6,500 lb with P&W 206E engines were equivalent to the 
 characteristics approved for the MD900 at a maximum weight of 6,500 lb with 
 P&W 206A engines. 
 The FAA determined that the noise characteristics of the MD900 incorporating 
 the thruster extension kit with P&W 206A, 206E, or 207E engines were 
 equivalent to the previously approved noise characteristics. 
 14 CFR part 36 as amended by Amendment 36-1 through Amendment 36-25, 
 Appendix J for certification at a maximum weight of 6,770 lb with P&W 207E 
 engines. 
 MDHI requested certification of the MD900 (902 configuration) to the proposed 
 Category A requirements for part 27 rotorcraft in Docket No. 28008; Notice No. 
 94-36, “Rotorcraft Regulatory Changes Based on European Joint Airworthiness 
 Requirements Proposals,” The FAA concurred with MDHI’s request and 
 subsequently certificated the MD900 for Category A operations. The Category 
 A requirements in NPRM 94-36, with minor changes, were incorporated into 
 part 27 as Appendix C – Criteria for Category A by Amendment 27-33. 
 Special Condition 
 Docket No. 91-ASW-2; Special Condition 29-ASW-2, “McDonnell Douglas 
 Model MD-900 Helicopter, Critical Functioning Electrical/Electronic Systems.” 
 Issued December 26, 1991. This special condition addresses protection for 
 electrical/electronic systems from High Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF). See 
 http://rgl.faa.gov for the full text of this special condition. 
 Equivalent Level of Safety (ELOS) Findings 
 ELOS No. TD9369LA-R/F-2, “MD Helicopters, Incorporated (MDHI), 
 Equivalent Level of Safety (ELOS) Finding to 14 CFR 27.143(c)(4) and 
 27.1587(a)(2)(ii).” This ELOS addresses low speed controllability and the 
 associated presentation of information in the RFM. 
 Equivalent Level of Safety (ELOS) finding for compliance to 29.1181(a) and 
 29.1191(a)(1) for the engine forward firewall. 
 Exemptions 
 Exemption No. 6505, “In the matter of the petition of McDonnell Douglas 
 Helicopter Systems for an exemption from Section 27.1(a) of Title 14, Code of 
 Federal Regulations,” issued on September 5, 1996. This exemption allowed 
 McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems to increase the maximum gross weight 
 of the MD900 from 6,000 lb to 7,000 lb. Title 14 CFR 27.1(a) was amended in 
 1999 to expand the maximum weight limit for normal category rotorcraft to 
 7,000 lb. 
 Exemption No. 7360, “In the matter of the petition of MD Helicopters Inc. for 
 an exemption from Section C36.105(c)(1) of Title 14, Code of Federal 
 Regulations” issued on September 27, 2000. (The section cited in the exemption 
 title is incorrect. The correct section, H36.105(c)(1), is discussed in the body of 
 the exemption.) This exemption allowed an alternative level flyover airspeed of 
 90 percent of the never-exceed airspeed (0.9VNE) for use in the 14 CFR part 36 
 noise certification of the MD900 at weights above 6,250 lb since at those 
 weights MDHI defined the VNE as 100 KTAS, a speed less than the true VH. 
 This exemption expired on July 2, 2004 when Appendix H was amended to 
 include this criteria. 
 Type Certificate 
 Date of application: April 25, 1989 
 Type Certificate No. H19NM, issued on December 2, 1994 
 TC reissued on February 8, 1999 to replace certificate reported lost.

 • 
 Day and night operation under instrument flight rules (IFR), see 
 requirements in Note 9."

Note 1,"A current Basic Weight and Balance Record, and MD900 Required/Optional 
 Equipment List must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original 
 certification."
Note 2,See FAA Approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual for required placards.
Note 3,"The retirement times of certain parts and inspection requirements are listed in 
 Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS), Section 04-00-00, of the Model 
 MD900 Maintenance Manual (CSP-900RMM-2). These values of retirement of 
 service lives and inspection cannot be increased without FAA approval. See 
 http://www.mdhelicopters.com/publications/pdf/pubs_index/900index.pdf to 
 determine the current revision of level of CSP-900RMM-2."
Note 4,"For initial type certification, MDHS elected to incorporate engine isolation 
 features that comply with engine isolation requirements in §§ 27.79(b)(2), 
 27.141(b)(1) and 27.143(d)(1). Compliance was shown by applying the limited 
 time period method presented in Advisory Circular AC 27-1. This method was 
 presented in paragraph 780 of the AC revision in effect when the MD900 was 
 initially certificated, but now resides in paragraph AC 27 MG 3 of the current 
 revision. This method was applied to the multiengine Category A engine 
 isolation requirements in part 29 as amended through Amendment 29-29."
Note 5,"On February 11, 1998, the FAA approved an enhanced version of the MD900 
 for Category A operations. The enhanced version, designated MD902 by 
 MDHI, is referred to by the FAA as the MD900 (902 Configuration). The 
 MD900 (902 Configuration) incorporated a number of changes, including 
 additional engine isolation features, changes to the Integrated Instrument 
 Display System (IIDS), and a separate RFM. These changes allowed the 
 MD900 (902 Configuration) to comply fully with Category A certification 
 requirements."
Note 6,"The MD900 rotorcraft employs electronic engine controls, commonly referred to 
 as Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC). Engines with FADEC are 
 recognized to be more susceptible to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) than 
 engines with manual (non-electronic) controls. For this reason, modifications 
 that add or change electrical systems that have the potential for EMI must be 
 qualified to an FAA acceptable standard. For guidance refer to section MG-4 of 
 Advisory Circular AC 27-1B Change 2, or later revision. See MDHI Service 
 Bulletin SB900-067R1 “Electromagnetic Compatibility Test” or latest approved 
 revision."
Note 7,"Any changes to the type design of this helicopter by means of an amended type 
 certificate (TC), supplemental type certificate (STC), or amended STC, 
 requiring instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA) must be submitted 
 through the project aircraft certification office (ACO) for review and acceptance 
 by the Fort Worth -Aircraft Evaluation Group (FTW-AEG) Flight Standards 
 District Office (FSDO) prior to the aircraft delivery, or upon issuance of the first 
 standard airworthiness certificate for the affected aircraft, whichever occurs later 
 as prescribed by Title 14 CFR 21.50. Type design changes (major repairs or 
 alterations) by means of a FAA Form 337 (field approval) that require ICA’s 
 must have those ICA’s reviewed by the field approving FSDO."
Note 8,"MD900 serial numbers 900-00008 through 900-00051 are eligible for 
 conversion to the enhanced version (902 configuration). Each eligible 
 helicopter, after conversion to the enhanced version in accordance with MDHI 
 Report No. 900R000378 Rev - or MDHI Technical Bulletin TB900-28, fully 
 complies with Category A certification requirements (See Certification Basis 
 and Note 5). The conversion includes replacement of the original Rotorcraft 
 Flight Manual with the Rotorcraft Flight Manual for the enhanced version, 
 MDHI Publication No. CSP-902RFM207E-1."
Note 9,"Model MD900 helicopters, S/N 900-00010 and subsequent, are eligible for day 
 and night IFR operations, when modified in accordance with MD Helicopters 
 Inc. STC SR00436WI-D. The STC addresses Single Pilot, Dual Pilot, and 
 Category A operations."
Note 10,"MD900s S/N 900-00010 through 900-00051 with PW 206A engines may 
 operate with increased One Engine Inoperative (OEI) torque limits with the 
 incorporation of Technical Bulletin TB900-010R1 or later approved revision."
