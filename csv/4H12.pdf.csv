 Model. If the service hours are not known, regardless of Model application, the component cannot be

 369/269). Components which have been interchanged between series of helicopters prior to revision 
 19 of this TCDS may continue in service to their respective retirement lives. Life limited components 
 interchanged between Models, configurations, or previously between series must be restricted to the 
 lowest service life indicated for the Models or configurations affected. Parts are applicable only on 
 Models under which a service life is listed. Interchanged components with known service hours but 
 without Model application identification may not exceed the lowest life listed for any applicable 
 Model. If the service hours are not known, regardless of Model application, the component cannot be 
 interchanged to Models that list the component as limited life. 
 (e) Life limited components removed when life limit has been reached must be destroyed or 
 permanently marked to prevent return to service. 
 (f) Alpha and/or numeric suffixes added to part numbers denote special manufacturing or handling 
 procedures and do not alter the replacement requirements of the part. For example, 269A5305-11 and 
 269A5305-11M2 are subject to the same requirements."
NOTE 9,"(a) The retirement times of critical parts for Model 269C-1 are listed in the following table. These 
 values of retirement or service life cannot be increased without approval by FAA Engineering.

 (c) It is prohibited to interchange life limited components between different series of helicopters (i.e. 
 369/269). Components which have been interchanged between series of helicopters prior to revision 
 19 of this TCDS may continue in service to their respective retirement lives. Life limited components 
 interchanged between Models, configurations, or previously between series must be restricted to the 
 lowest service life indicated for the Models or configurations affected. Parts are applicable only on 
 Models under which a service life is listed. Interchanged components with known service hours but 
 without Model application identification may not exceed the lowest life listed for any applicable 
 Model. If the service hours are not known, regardless of Model application, the component cannot be 
 interchanged to Models that list the component as limited life. 
 (d) Life limited components removed when life limit has been reached must be destroyed or 
 permanently marked to prevent return to service. 
 (e) The 269A2402 Vertical Stabilizer is part of the 269A2320-13 Tail Boom Assembly. The Vertical 
 Stabilizer has the same service life (2,100 hours) as does the Tail Boom and therefore the vertical 
 stabilizer shall be retired with the Tail Boom Assembly. 
 (f) Some Parts may appear to be interchangeable between the Model 269C-1 and other 269 series 
 helicopters. However due to differences in maintenance schedules, only the most current dash 
 numbers as defined in Note 9(b) are applicable for installation on the Model 269C-1. 
 (g) Alpha and/or numeric suffixes added to part numbers denote special manufacturing or handling 
 procedures and do not alter the replacement requirements of the part. For example, 269A5305-11 and 
 269A5305-11M2 are subject to the same requirements. 
 (h) 269A5193 Carrier is part of 269A5194 Carrier Assembly."
NOTE 10,"Noise Substantiation: 
 Although not part of the Certification Basis, the Model 269C Helicopter is compliant with the 
 requirements of FAR Part 36 Appendix J, Amendment 20."
NOTE 11,"Model 269D, Configuration M or MB: 
 Helicopter serial numbers containing the suffix “M” or “MB” that have been delivered to a foreign 
 customer as Model 269D, Configuration M or MB (military) helicopters. These aircraft are not eligible 
 for issuance of an FAA Certificate of Airworthiness. Life limited components flown on Configuration 
 M or MB aircraft are not eligible for installation on 269D, Configuration A or 269D helicopters."
