Import Requirements,"To be considered eligible for operation in the United States, each aircraft manufactured under this 
 Type Certificate must have a U.S. Airworthiness Certificate that may be issued on the basis of the 
 Canadian Department of Transport Certificate of Airworthiness for Export signed by the Minister of 
 Transport containing the following statement: 
 “The rotorcraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested and found to comply with the 
 type design approved under Type Certificate R00001RC and to be in condition for safe operation.” 
 The approved type design for the model 427 consists of data listed on Bell top drawing 427-100-001, 
 Revision CY, or later approved revision and the incorporation of Bell kit 427-706-018 (fuel shut off 
 valve kit). For helicopter serial numbers 56001 through 56043, either ASB 427-01-05 must be 
 incorporated or Bell kit 427-706-019 (FAA Type Certification Kit) must be installed. See NOTE 9. 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft certificated under FAR section 21.29 and 
 exported by the country of manufacture is FAR Section 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United States of both 
 new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any required statements by the 
 exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures 
 for coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, 
 Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for 
 imported aircraft.

Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations (see 
 certification basis) must be installed in the helicopter for certification. 
 In addition, the following items of equipment are required: 
 1) For approved MGW configuration of 2722 kg (6000 lb.) Transport Canada approved Rotorcraft 
 Flight Manual BHT-427-FM-1 dated November 19, 1999 or later approved revision. 
 2) For approved MGW configuration of 2880 kg (6350 lb.) Transport Canada approved Rotorcraft 
 Flight Manual BHT-427-FM-2 dated April 27, 2000, or later approved revision. 
 3) For approved MGW configuration 2971 kg (6550 lb.) Transport Canada approved Rotorcraft

NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of required equipment and list of equipment 
 included in certificated empty weight, and loading instructions when necessary must be provided for 
 each helicopter at the time of original certification. The certificated empty weight and corresponding 
 C.G. locations must include undrainable oil and unusable fuel for the appropriate model."
NOTE 2,"The following placard must be displayed in front of and in clear view of the pilot: “THIS 
 HELICOPTER MUST BE OPERATED IN COMPLIANCE WITH OPERATING LIMITATIONS

 other rotorcraft. EMI may be the result of radiated or conducted interference. For this reason, 
 modifications that add or change systems that have the potential for EMI, must either be qualified to 
 an FAA acceptable standard or tested at the time of installation for interference to the engine 
 controls. This type of testing must employ the particular engine control’s diagnostic techniques and 
 external diagnostic techniques. This testing must be accomplished in accordance with FAA

 Office (FSDO) prior to the aircraft delivery, or upon issuance of the first standard airworthiness 
 certificate for the affected aircraft, whichever occurs later as prescribed by Title 14 CFR 21.50. Type 
 design changes by means of a field approval that require ICA's must have those ICA's reviewed by 
 the field approving FSDO."
NOTE 7,"The model 427 incorporates an emergency OEI limit override function. When this feature is 
 selected, damage to the engine and transmission is experienced and continued flight is not permitted. 
 Use of this emergency power invalidates the airworthiness of the aircraft and maintenance in 
 accordance with the model 427 Maintenance Manual is required to return the aircraft to an airworthy 
 condition."
