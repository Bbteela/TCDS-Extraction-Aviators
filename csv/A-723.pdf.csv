 NOTE 1. (a) An approved Lockheed weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated weight 
 empty, and loading instructions when necessary, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and 
 (b) Lear Report No. 17 ""Weight and Balance and Equipment List"" showing interior arrangement and locations and 
 capacities of cargo and luggage compartments shall be in each ""Learstar"" modification of the Lockheed Model 
 18 at the time of original approval and at all times thereafter. 
 NOTE 2. (a) Placard lavatory door as follows: ""This room not to be occupied during takeoff and landing."" 
 (b) A placard which states the order in which the fuel tanks are to be used must be installed at the fuel selector 
 valve. The order of using fuel shall be the same as indicated in the loading instructions. (In lieu of posting such 
 a placard in air carrier airplanes, and subject to the approval of the Chief, Air Carrier Safety Division, definite 
 instructions must be issued by the operator to the effect that fuel tanks should be filled and used in order 
 indicated in their approved loading instructions.) 
 (c) For those airplanes requiring an ""Airplane Flight Manual"", the following placard shall be placed on the 
 instrument panel in full view of the pilot, and when appropriate, the instruments should be properly marked: 
 ""This airplane shall be operated in compliance with the operating limitations specified in the CAA Approved 
 Airplane Flight Manual 
 (d) The following propeller placards shall be placed on the instrument panel in full view of the pilot and the 
 tachometer appropriately marked for those airplanes on which the propellers listed below are installed. 
 below 1450 RPM and between 1650 and 1850 RPM."" 
 NOTE 3. Fuel jettisoning provisions are not required for aircraft having not more than 1000 lbs. spread between maximum 
 takeoff and maximum landing weight. If dump valves other than Item 102(a) are installed, the former shall be 
 removed or made positively inoperative 
 NOTE 4. Maximum landing or takeoff weight may be increased 105 lbs. when complete de-icer system is installed. Applicable 
 to aircraft up to 19,500 lbs. takeoff weight only. 
 NOTE 5. For certification at 18,500 lbs. takeoff weight (or landing weight as cargo carrier) Model 18 airplanes of Serial Nos. 
 2001 to 2024, inclusive, must be modified structurally to conform with drawing changes and new drawings listed on 
 Lockheed Service Project Drawing No. 1037. Airplanes of Serial Nos. 2025 and up have had the structural revisions 
 necessary for eligibility at 18,500 lbs. takeoff weight (or landing weight as cargo carrier) incorporated in the 
 airplanes at the factory 
 NOTE 6. Replacement surfaces which incorporate flush type riveting may be substituted for surfaces having external head type 
 rivets except that in the event that an outer wing panel or wing tip (with external head rivet) is being replaced by a 
 flush type rivet panel, both left and right surfaces must be replaced. 
 NOTE 7. All Model 18 aircraft which have been modified in accordance with NOTE 5 are eligible as cargo carriers with a",

AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES,"(a) Each airplane must satisfactorily pass an inspection for conformity, possible hidden damage, and for 
 workmanship and materials used in making any repairs and/or alternations. Particular attention should be paid 
 to placards, instrument markings and windshield equipment. 
 (b) The following military equipment should be removed: Propane priming, auxiliary fuel tanks and supporting 
 structure. Such brackets and supporting structure as will not interfere with the safe operation of the aircraft 
 may, at the operator's discretion, be left in the aircraft as long as the equipment has been rendered inoperative. 
 Operators may retain the oil dilution system and hopper type oil tank upon compliance with paragraph 1 of 
 Airworthiness Directive 46-13-3. Otherwise the installation of a conventional oil tank and rework of the 
 standpipe will be required in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of Airworthiness Directive 46-13-3. 
 unit, Part No. JH6000, are installed, they should be of the modified version identified by a yellow ""M"" adjacent 
 to name plate, as covered in Jack & Heintz Service Bulletin No. P-1. If the Jack & Heintz A-3A autopilot servo 
 units are installed, they should be of the modified version in which the over-power differential pressure is 
 limited to 175+15 psi, as covered in Jack & Heintz Service Bulletin No. P-4. The modified unit is identified by"
a new name plate (JH11609) on which CAA approval is indicated. CAA approved model numbers will be one,
shall be of fireresistant material,"(e) Each airplane must be weighed to determine its weight and balance and an approved loading chart or device 
 must be installed. The loading chart or device should be prepared in accordance with Lockheed Service 
 Information Letter No. 18-33. An equipment list must be prepared. This list, the approved loading chart or 
 device, and the weight and balance data will constitute the Weight and Balance Report for the particular 
 airplane. If any changes have been made which would adversely affect the flight characteristics, the airplane"
must be flight tested,"In compiling the equipment list for an airplane, reference should be made to the Lockheed Master Equipment 
 List to determine that all Class 100 items or satisfactory alternates are installed. Certain Class 200 items on the 
 Master List may also be required by the type of operation which is to be authorized. If any of the equipment 
 items installed bear Air Force designations, their acceptability for civil use should be determined or they should"
be replaced,"(f) All Aero Supply PK-3 type fuel selector valves manufactured prior to 1943 must be reworked to incorporate the 
 new metal retainer washer (cup type) and the new Hycar seals. The year of manufacture can be determined 
 from the prefix of the number stamped on the mounting bolt hole boss, i.e., 2-567 means 1942 and 3-567 means 
 1943. Stamp the reworked valves with the designation letters CPRW-H (cup plate - Hycar) to show the rework 
 has been accomplished. (Lockheed Service Telegram dated November 17, 1943, covers this same subject.) 
 (g) (Applies only to serial numbers 1954, 1956, 1957 and 2001 through 2075.) The Vickers AA-14000 accumulator 
 must be removed and Bendix 401531 7-1/2 inch accumulator and AN 6234-3 filter installed. Also the 55285 
 hydraulic reservoir must be reworked to increase its capacity to 2.3 gallons. (Lockheed Service Bulletin 18/SN- 
 120 dated April 21, 1945, covers this same subject.) 
 (h) On airplanes with low pressure brakes equipped with deboosters, it may be necessary to install a longer hose in 
 the inboard end of each debooster to eliminate interference with the drag strut knee bolt. (Lockheed Service 
 Information Letter dated August 1, 1945, revised December 10, 1945, covers this same subject.)"
i,"On all Wright C9GC (G-200 Series) engines, remove the upper valve washers, Part Nos. 69271 and 113171. 
 Engines equipped with the two spring combination are satisfactory without change. For engines equipped with 
 the three spring combination, it will be satisfactory to use Part Nos. 118815, 113171 or No. 113171J. If either 
 of the latter two is used, it should be of the high dimension type (0.60) inch total height.) (Wright Service 
 Bulletin no. C912A covers this same subject.)"
