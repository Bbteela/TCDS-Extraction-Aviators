 Model Army UC-64A, UC-64B, UC-64AS or Norseman MK VI 
 Model Norseman MK V (Normal Category) approved January 27, 1992 
 (The UC-64 and UC-64B are similar and differ from the UC-64A principally in regard to the airframe structure, the 
 electrical system and the fuel tank construction. The UC-64A landing gear accommodates larger shock struts). The UC- 
 64AS is equipped with Edo floats (see item 203). The Norseman MK V is a civilian, nonmilitary version of the 
 Norseman MK VI with increased disposable load capacity due to the removal and elimination of military equipment.)",

 NOTE 1. Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight and loading 
 instructions when necessary, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter 
 Each airplane must be weighed to determine its weight and balance prior to original certification unless a satisfactory 
 Army weight and balance report is available. 
 NOTE 2. Prior to certification as a civil aircraft the following must be accomplished: 
 (Applies to all models: UC-64, UC-64A, UC-64AS, and MK V)",
a,"The following placards must be installed in full view of the pilot: 
 (1) ""Intentional Spins Prohibited."" 
 (2) ""Use 15° flaps for take-off."" 
 (3) ""Use rear fuselage fuel tank in level flight only."" 
 (4) For UC-64AS only: ""CAUTION: Water rudders must be raised before take-off and left in that position 
 during flight and until taxing recommences."" 
 (b) Mark instruments for approved operation limits."
c,"Date of conversion to certificated status must be marked on identification plate. 
 (d) Fuel gauges must be checked for accuracy."
e,Tie-downs suitable to prevent shifting of cargo must be provided if cargo is to be carried.
f,"Passenger seats and safety belt installations other than originally provided by the manufacturer must be of an 
 approved type or shown to meet the strength requirements of CAR 4. Bucket type sets are acceptable."
g,"All fuel tank filler caps or adjacent surface must be marked to indicate the minimum octane fuel and the tank 
 capacity. 
 (h) The oil tank filler cap must be marked ""OIL"" and indicate capacity."
i,"(1) For day operation, non-trip-free circuit breakers in circuits used in day operation must be replaced with 
 trip-free breakers as soon as such breakers become generally available. Airplane should be restricted to 
 day operation. 
 (2) To make the airplane eligible for night operation, the following must be accomplished: 
 Install approved landing flares. 
 Replace all non-trip circuit breakers with trip-free breakers as soon as such breakers become generally 
 available. 
 Install approved type position lights."
j,"Inspect the carburetor hot air intake system to ascertain that there is no leakage of cold air between the hot air 
 shroud and the carburetor. Also determine that the butterfly gate assembly and valve spring fit properly. These 
 items must be satisfactory to obtain adequate carburetor air heat rise. Also ascertain that the carburetor air 
 mixing chamber is securely braced to the engine to prevent failure due to the excessive overhang."
l,"Seal any openings in the firewall with material equivalent to the firewall material. 
 (m) The engine nameplate must have the following information added: 
 ""C.A.A. Specification No. 5E-2."" 
 (n) The Surface Combustion fuel burning heater must be made inoperative by disconnecting and plugging the fuel 
 line as near the engine as practicable unless the following modifications are accomplished: 
 (1) A fire resistant bulkhead must be installed between the heater and the belly fuel tank. A firewall having 
 the 
 fire resistant qualities specified in CAR 03.4700 will be acceptable. 
 (2) A fuel shut-off valve, controllable from the pilots' compartment must be installed in the fuel line between 
 the engine and the heater. 
 (3) Shrouds must be installed on the heater exhaust and drain lines to isolate the lines from the airframe.
