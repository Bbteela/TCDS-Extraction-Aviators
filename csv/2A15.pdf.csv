 and other service information, when FAA approved, will carry a statement to that effect."
NOTE 1,"(a) 
 Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, 
 and loading instructions must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times 
 thereafter except in the case of operators having an approved weight control system. Approved 
 weight and balance data is contained in the Jet Star Handbook of Weight and Balance Data. 
 (b) 
 The airplane must be loaded so that the (zero fuel weight) c.g. is within the specified limits at all times 
 (reference c.g. range). 
 (c) 
 The weight of system fuel and oil as defined below, and hydraulic fluid, must be included in the 
 airplane empty weight. 
 System fuel: The weight of all fuel required to fill all lines and tanks up to the zero fuel point on the 
 fuel gauges in level flight attitude (3 degrees and 30 minutes nose-up). This includes the unusable 
 fuel as defined by CAR 4b.416.

 * Fuel weights are based on a fuel density of 6.9 lbs./gal. 
 System Oil (including unusable): The weight of oil remaining in the engines, tanks and lines after 
 subtracting the usable oil from the total capacity: 3.75 lbs. each, 15 lbs. total, arm 594.0. System oil and all 
 hydraulic fluid must be included in the airplane empty weight. 
 (d) 
 Zero fuel weight of 23,700 lbs. approved when interior modifications conform to the criteria of 
 Lockheed Report ER-5500M, revised February 2, 1962. 
 Zero fuel weight of 24,500 lbs. approved when interior modifications conform to the criteria of 
 Lockheed Report ER-5500M, revised August 15, 1963, and when structural modifications are 
 incorporated in accordance with Lock heed Service Bulletin No. 329-138 dated August 30, 1963. 
 Zero fuel weight may be increased to 25,000 lbs. after incorporation of the provisions of Lockheed 
 Service Bulletin No. 329-138B dated December 1965 for the Model 1329-23 series airplanes. 
 Zero fuel weight of 27,500 lbs. approved when interior modifications conform to the criteria of 
 Lockheed Report ER-5500M-II, revised February 8, 1977, for the Model 1329-25 series airplanes. 
 (e) 
 Fuel loading and usage procedures are dictated by structural design, and to maintain airplane c.g. 
 within approved limits. 
 Refer to FAA approved Airplane Flight Manual for take-off, landing, and normal fuel distribution 
 limitations, normal fuel system management, and fuel system malfunction procedures. 
 Fuel must be loaded symmetrically about the airplane centerline. 
 Any landing with more than 500 lbs.* of fuel in either external tank must be considered an 
 overweight landing and an overweight landing inspection must be accomplished. 
 *2,250 lbs., S/N 5066 and up, and lower S/Ns incorporating JetStar Service Bulletin No. 329-157. 
 This limitation also applies to S/N 5201 and up. 
 (f) 
 Fuel jettison capability must be available for operation of the airplane in excess of the maximum 
 landing weight. The unjettisonable fuel must be included in the airplane landing weight. The amount 
 of usable fuel remaining in the tanks after complete jettisoning is as follows: 
 Tanks 1, 2, 3, and 4: 
 1,000 lbs. each, 
 Total 4,000 lbs. 
 External tanks:
