NOTE 9,"Type Certificate Holder Record 
 The Model DA 62 was originally certified by EASA as a derivative of the DA 42 and was approved on TC 
 EASA.A.005. The derivative was validated by FAA under TCDS A57CE. 
 The Model DA 62 was later certified on TC EASA.A.629 as a stand-alone model. Effective 15-Nov-2017, the 
 design responsibility for the Model DA 62 certified under TC EASA.A.629 was transferred from Diamond 
 Aircraft Industries GmbH and EASA to Diamond Aircraft Industries Inc. and Transport Canada under TC A-273. 
 Aircraft manufactured against TC EASA.A.005 were eligible to be transferred to TC EASA.A.629 in accordance 
 with DAI Factory Campaign FC 62-010, which included installing a new data plate that included the new TC 
 number. 
 The TC EASA.A.629 had not been validated by the FAA prior to the transfer of the state of design responsibities 
 to TCCA and aircraft that had been manufractured under EASA.A.005 continued to be covered only by FAA 
 TCDS A57CE until FAA TCDS A00012NY was approved. 
 Serial numbers originally produced under TC EASA.A.005 and still associated with that TC (identified by the 
 data plate) remained under the responsibility of Diamond Aircraft Industries GmbH and EASA until they were 
 transferred to TCCA type certificate A-273 under Factory Campaign FC 62-010/4. Those serial numbers 
 originally produced under EASA.A.005 and accepted under FAA TC A57CE are eligible to be transferred to 
 FAA TC A00012NY under that Factory Campaign which will include the addition of a supplemental data plate to 
 show FAA TC A00012NY."
