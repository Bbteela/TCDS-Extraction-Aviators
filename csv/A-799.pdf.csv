 packed snow at temperatures approximately 30°F. skiplane takeoff 
 distance is approximately 10 percent greater than the distance shown for 
 the landplane. Skiplane landing distance is approximately 20 percent 
 greater than that shown for the landplane. In applying the performance 
 data, caution should be exercised in that lower temperatures or other snow 
 conditions will increase the ski friction and hence increase the takeoff run 
 and either increase or decrease the landing run. 
 Climb Performance: The skiplane rate of climb is approximately 50 feet 
 per minute less than the landplane.""
