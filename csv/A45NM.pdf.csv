 Former test article aircraft S/No’s.: 3001, 3002, 3003, and 3004."
Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an Export Certificate 
 of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the LBA on behalf 
 of the European Community. 
 The Export C of A should contain the following statement: ‘The aircraft 
 covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to conform 
 with the Type Design approved under U.S. Type Certificate No. A45NM and 
 to be in a condition for safe operation.’ 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 14 
 CFR part 21, section 21.29, exported by country of manufacture is section 
 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under 
 section 21.29 exported from countries other than the country of manufacture (e.g., 
 third party country) is section 21.183(d) or 21.185(b)."
Certification Basis,"Mod 00: FAR Part 25 Effective February 1, 1965, including Amendments 25-1

 Mod 10, Mod 20: The certification basis for the Mod 10 and Mod 20 
 airplanes is the same as for the basic Mod 00 airplane. 
 All Variants 
 Based on 14 CFR section 21.29(a) for new import TCs, or section 21.101(g) for 
 changes to TCs, applicable provisions of 14 CFR Part 26 are included in the 
 certification basis. For any future 14 CFR Part 26 amendments, the holder of this 
 TC must demonstrate compliance with the applicable sections. 
 The Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA) originally type certificated this aircraft under its 
 type certificate Number 2534. The FAA validated this product under U.S. Type 
 Certificate number A45NM. Effective September 28, 2003, the European
