 rotorcraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested and found to comply with 
 the type design approved under Type Certificate H3EU and to be in condition for safe 
 operation"". 
 The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export Certificate of 
 Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the German LBA on behalf 
 of the European Community. 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness (or 
 equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of 
 Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft. 
 The Export C of A should contain the following statement: “The aircraft covered by this 
 certificate has been examined, test, and found to comply with the German LBA TC 
 Number 3025 approved under the U.S. Type Certificate Number H3EU and to be in a 
 condition for safe operation.”"
