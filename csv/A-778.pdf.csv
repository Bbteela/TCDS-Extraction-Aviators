 With the airplane leveled these angles are measured by means of a bubble protractor or 
 inclinometer resting on the control surface (for the Model V flap the protractor rests on 
 a straight edge held against the bottom surface) at the trailing edge just forward of the 
 pinked tape and at the stations indicated below. A slight pressure of the thumb and 
 finger holding the rear of the instrument against the surface is necessary. 
 Ailerons - at inner end rib. 
 Flaps - at first rib inboard of middle hinge. 
 Stabilizer - at first rib outboard of elevator. 
 Elevator - at end rib. 
 Since any variation in the relationship between the flap and stabilizer angles has critical 
 effects on the operational characteristics of the airplane no tolerance on these angles is 
 permitted."
