SPECIFICATIONS PERTINENT TO ALL MODELS,
Certification Basis,"The certification basis for the AASI Jetcruzer 450 is: 
 14 CFR part 23, effective February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 23-1 through 
 23-42; effective February 2, 1991; § 23.905(e) of Amendment 23-43 for protection of the 
 pusher propeller from ice impingement; § 23.905(f) of Amendment 23-43 for pusher 
 propeller disc conspicuity; § 23.905(g) of Amendment 23-43 for protection of the pusher 
 propeller from exhaust gas impingement; § 23.925(b) of Amendment 23-43 for pusher 
 propeller ground clearance; § 23.1203(a) of Amendment 23-43 for engine fire detection 
 system; Part 34, effective September 10, 1990; Part 36, through Amendment 36-20, 
 effective September 11, 1992; and the following special conditions and exemption 
 (special conditions 1 and 6, as proposed in Notice No. 23-ACE-61, are issued as final 
 special conditions 1 and 2): 
 Special Condition 1, Evaluation of Composite Structure, and 
 Special Condition 2, Protection of Electrical and Electronic Systems from High Intensity 
 Radiated Fields 
 Exemption No. 5594, grants an exemption from a portion of § 23.903(e)(2) of the FAR 
 which requires, in pertinent part, that a means be provided for stopping the rotation of 
 any turbine engine. 
 For the metal structures, conducting of damage tolerance analysis provides an equivalent 
 level of safety as envisioned in the regulations and thus meets the requirements of § 
 23.572(a)(1). 
 Compliance with § 23.1091(c)(2), Water Ingestion, was found by equivalent level of 
 safety by prohibiting takeoff or landing with standing water on the runway. Appropriate 
 testing must be conducted prior to the removal of the limitation. 
 NOTE: As a result of AASI decision to seek initial certification without advanced 
 electronic system, Special Condition 2 is not considered necessary for initial type 
 certification. For following certification with advanced electronic system installed, 
 compliance with Special Condition 2 is required."
Production Basis,"None. Prior to original certification of each aircraft, an FAA representative must perform 
 a detailed inspection for workmanship, materials, and conformity with the approved 
 technical data, and a check of the flight characteristics."
Equipment,"The basic equipment required as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. This equipment 
 must include the following: 
 * A current Airplane Flight Manual. 
 * 120 lbs movable ballast."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in certificated 
 empty weight, and loading instruction when necessary must be provided for each aircraft 
 at the time of original certification. 
 The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of gravity locations must include 
 total oil capacity and unusable fuel as noted below: 
 * Unusable fuel (8.0 gal) 53.6 lbs at 286.0"""
NOTE 2,"The following placard must be displayed in front of and in clear view of the pilot. 
 ""This airplane must be operated as a Normal Category airplane in compliance with 
 operating limitations stated in Airplane Flight Manual"". See Approved Airplane Flight 
 Manual for additional placards. ""All placards required in the Approved Airplane Flight 
 Manual must be installed in the appropriate location""."
NOTE 3,"Aircraft Service Life is limited to 500 flight hours. When the damage tolerance analysis 
 AASI Report Nos. ER-5141 and ER-5142 of the aircraft are submitted and approved, the 
 service life will then be readjusted based upon the determined threshold of each Principal 
 Structural Element together with their inspection intervals. 
 Fuel Quantity Measuring System Indicator P/N 81-240-1 and Transmitter P/N 75-169-3, 
 which are not qualified to TSO C55, are service life limited to 100 hrs T.B.O. 
 The HC-B3TN-3UL/LT10173N-21R propeller is required to have repetitive blade 
 inspection for erosion and/or corrosion at intervals not to exceed 24 months or 600 hours 
 of operation, whichever occurs first. See Hartzell S/B 181, dated 3/12/93 or later 
 revision for the inspection procedures. 
 These limitations may not be changed without FAA engineering approval."
NOTE 4,"Aircraft is not eligible for installation of avionics equipment (HF, VHF, Nav/Com radios, 
 transponder, etc) without complete Electromagnetic and Radio Frequency Interference 
 (EMI/RFI) ground and flight test due to known interference with previously approved 
 equipment (Fuel Quantity Gauging System)."
NOTE 5,"Each aircraft produced must be flight tested specifically to show compliance to § 
 23.207(c) of 14 CFR Part 23, using at least a swiveling pitot boom and sensitive airspeed 
 indicator.
