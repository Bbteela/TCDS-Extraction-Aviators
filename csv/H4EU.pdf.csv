 of Airworthiness for Export signed by a representative of the Direction Generale 
 de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC) containing the following statement: 
 ""The rotorcraft covered by this certificate has been examined and found to 
 comply with U.S. FAR Part 29, including: 
 - for Models F and G, amendments 29-1 through 29-5. 
 - for Models J, amendments 29-1 through 29-9 plus para. 29.951(c), 29.1183 
 and 29.1305(a)(16) of amendment 29-10. 
 Plus Special Conditions No. 29-29-EU-5 dated 19 August 1970 and criteria for 
 compliance with FAR 29.141 for IFR operation in FAA letter to SGAC dated 
 15 February 1971 and conforms to Type Certificate No. H4EU. 
 This helicopter is eligible for import only when the Overhaul Manual is available 
 per FAR 29.1529 and 21.29(a)(3) as amended by Amendment FAR 21.25."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment (see List Number 330A.04.1155, 17 September 1970 
 as revised) as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations (see Certification 
 Basis) must be installed in the helicopter for certification. 
 In addition, the following items of equipment are required: 
 - DGAC(formerly SGAC) approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual. 
 - One clock for each pilot with sweep second pointer. 
 - One gyroscope bank and pitch indicator for each required pilot, 
 non-tumbling for IFR (original approval with SFENA 4286.V3, four inches 
 diameter). 
 - One gyroscopic direction indicator for each required pilot (original approval 
 with SFIM CG121PN 54794.1 for co-pilot: COLLINS PN 101 Type 
 331A3G PN 522-2638-009 for pilot, three inches diameter). 
 - One rate of climb indicator for each required pilot (original approval with
