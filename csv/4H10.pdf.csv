NOTE 2,"The following placards must be installed so as to be in full view of the pilot : 
 (a) Below airspeed indicator: “Decrease Vne 2.0 knots per 1000 feet of altitude above 2000 feet.” 
 (b) Below tachometer: “Above 6000 ft, see operating limitations.” 
 (c) On cabin heater outlet: “Use cabin heat in cruise and climb only.” 
 (d) On pilot’s checklist: 
 (1) If ash tray is not installed: “No smoking.” 
 (2) “This helicopter must be operated in compliance with the operating limitations in the FAA 
 approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual.” 
 (3) “Instrument flight prohibited” 
 (4) “No acrobatic maneuvers approved.” 
 (5) “Unsymmetrical loading must be to the left.” 
 (6) “Avoid protracted rearward flight.” 
 (7) “See Loading Instructions in Flight Manual.”

NOTE 3,"Information essential to the proper maintenance of the rotorcraft (helicopter) including retirement 
 times of critical parts is included in the manufacturer’s maintenance instructions provided with each 
 rotorcraft. These values of retirement or service life cannot be increased without FAA Engineering 
 approval."
NOTE 4,"These helicopters must be serviced and maintained in conformance with instructions given by Hiller 
 Helicopters in the pertinent model inspection guide, repair handbook, and service and overhaul 
 manuals."
NOTE 5,"Certain part numbers used on this model helicopter may be used on other model helicopters in which 
 their use is life limited. These part numbers are listed in TCDS 4H11, H1WE, 4H10, 6H1, and 6H2 
 and FAA approved Hiller Instructions for Continued Airworthiness. If a full and complete service 
 history from manufacture forward is not available that demonstrates these parts were used only on a 
 model helicopter for which the part is not life limited then those parts shall be life limited to the 
 lowest number of hours given in those TCDS’s or ICAs. If a full and complete service history from 
 the manufacturer forward is available, and any operating time has occurred in a life limited model 
 helicopter, that part shall be considered life limited at the lowest life limit listed even if transferred 
 and used on a helicopter model for which it is not life limited. Only those parts for which a full and 
 complete service history from manufacture forward is available and which shows only operating time 
 on a helicopter model for which it is not life limited are considered not life limited."
