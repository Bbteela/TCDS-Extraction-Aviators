 NOTE 1. Eligible for civil certification for solo flying or carriage of cargo or goods only. Prior to original certification 
 the following must be accomplished: 
 (a) Carburetor Anti-icing 
 (1) Add an alcohol anti-icing system of not less than 3 gallon tank capacity. The anti-icing fluid pump 
 must be capable of delivering a flow rate of not less than 10 gallons per hour. 
 (2) As an alternate to (1) above, an improved preheat system capable of providing a 100 degree F. heat 
 rise at 75 percent power in 30 degree F. outside air may be installed. 
 (b) In order to be eligible for certification for day operation, fuses in circuits to electrical equipment used 
 in such operation must be made accessible to the pilot in flight. 
 (c) In order to be eligible for night operation the position lights must be replaced with approved type 
 lights. In addition, fuses in circuits to electrical equipment used in such operation must be made 
 accessible to the pilot in flight. 
 (d) Seats. Remove the center and rear seats and install suitable cargo tie-downs or cargo compartments. 
 (e) Dual Flight Controls. Remove the dual flight controls from the center compartment, or “box-in” these 
 controls in such a manner as to render them inoperative as well as to preclude the possibility of 
 interference by cargo. 
 (f) Submit a weight and balance report, loading schedule and/or loading placard showing the cargo load 
 and disposition and order of fuel tank usage. Two hundred pounds (maximum) may be carried in the 
 baggage compartment and 200 lbs. (plus weight of seats and other equipment removed) may be carried 
 in the center and rear seat compartments. 
 The changes made to comply with Items (a), (c), (d), and (e) should be submitted to the nearest FAA Aircraft 
 Certification Office for approval 
 NOTE 2. The C.G. limits were determined with the landing gear extended. The airplane must be loaded so that its C.G. 
 position with the landing gear extended is always between the limits shown. 
 NOTE 3. The following placards must be displayed on the instrument panel in full view of the pilot: 
 (a) “Do not lower landing gear when speed is above 125 mph.” 
 (b) “Intentional acrobatics prohibited.” 
 NOTE 4. Unless suitable oil measuring device is installed, oil tank must be placarded: “Fill at least until oil can be 
 drained from petcock.” 
 NOTE 5. Airplane eligible for patrol and photographic operation. The center and rear seats may be retained in the 
 airplane for these operations, but the following placard must be installed on instrument panel: “Only 
 personnel essential to the purpose of the flight may be carried.”",
