Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (see certification basis) must be installed in the aircraft for 
 certification. In addition, the following items of equipment are required: (a) 
 FAA Approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of required equipment and equipment included 
 in certificated empty weight, and loading instructions when necessary, must be provided for each 
 helicopter at the time of original certification. The certificated empty weight and corresponding 
 C.G. locations must include undrainable oil of 5 lb (+234.0) and unusable fuel of 26 lb (10 lb at

 LIMITATIONS SPECIFIED IN THE FAA APPROVED ROTORCRAFT FLIGHT MANUAL."""
NOTE 3,"Provisions for the carriage of external loads are available in the form of structural hard points on 
 the fuselage and main landing gear; single point hoist; and a four point load leveler suspension 
 system. Information concerning the operating limitations with this equipment is contained in the 
 Rotorcraft Flight Manual."
NOTE 4,"Information essential to the proper maintenance of the helicopter is contained in the manufacturer’s 
 Maintenance Manual provided with each helicopter. In addition to the maintenance manuals, the 
 helicopters are to be serviced and maintained according to the following Service Bulletins:

 Model S-64F 
 1. Service Bulletin 64F General-2 for component maximum recommended time between overhaul. 
 In addition, the following Airworthiness Limitations have been established for this Rotorcraft: 
 Model S-64E 
 1. Service Bulletin 64B General-1 for component retirement times. FAA approved by the 
 Rotorcraft Certification Office (RCO). 
 Model S-64F 
 1. Service Bulletin 64F General-1 Time Limits-Retirement Schedule. FAA approved. 
 2. Service Bulletin 64F General-3 Mandatory Structural Inspections. FAA approved."
NOTE 5,"Prior to Airworthiness certification as a Model S-64F helicopter, either a military Model CH-54B 
 helicopter must be inspected and modified according to Erickson Air-Crane Document No. 1097 
 “Master Conversion Drawing List, CH-54B to S-64F”, or conforms to Erickson Air-Crane General 
 Arrangement Drawing 6401-10015, Rev. D, or later FAA approved revision level."
NOTE 6,"Prior to Airworthiness certification as Model S-64E helicopter, military Model CH-54A 
 helicopters must be inspected and modified according to Erickson Air-Crane Document No. 
 1077, “Modification of CH-54A to S-64E Helicopter”, or confoms to Erickson Air-Crane General 
 Arrangement Drawing 6401-10021, Rev. IR, or later FAA approved revision level."
NOTE 7,Revision No. 5 to this TCDS was not published by the FAA.
NOTE 8,Both S-64E and S-64F models are also known as “Industrial Flying Crane Helicopters.”
