 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness 
 (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification

 CH.21G.0002, issued by the Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA)."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. 
 An FAA approved (M)MEL may be used to operate the aircraft with inoperative 
 equipment."
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the European 
 Aviation Safety Agency (EASA): 
 • Service bulletins, 
 • Structural repair manuals, 
 • Vendor manuals, 
 • Aircraft flight manuals, and 
 • Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved for type design 
 data only unless one of the following conditions exists: 
 • The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures of the FAA 
 approved manuals; or 
 • The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this product’s U.S. 
 type certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. The 
 FAA may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to approve on behalf of the FAA for the 
 U.S. type certificate. If this is the case it will be noted on the document.
