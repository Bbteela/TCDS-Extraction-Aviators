 When Federal AWA-2500 or AWB-2500 wheel skis are installed, the following supplemental 
 information shall be appended to the Airplane Flight Manual: 
 Performance Information with Federal AWA-2500 Wheel Ski Installation Climb: 
 “Skiplane climb performance is approximately 50 feet per minute less than the Landplane.” 
 Take-off and Landing: 
 “Under the most favorable conditions of smooth packed snow at temperatures approximately 
 30°F, Skiplane takeoff distance is approximately 10% greater than the distance shown for the 
 Landplane. Skiplane landing distance is approximately 20% greater than that shown for the 
 Landplane. In applying the performance data, caution should be exercised in that lower 
 temperatures or other snow conditions will increase the ski friction and hence increase the takeoff 
 run and either increase or decrease the landing run.”
