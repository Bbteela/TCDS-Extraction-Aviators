Datum,100 inches forward of main rotor centerline.
Leveling Means,"For weight and balance: Level placed laterally and longitudinally on aft tunnel 
 cover immediately forward of aft middle seat. If cover is not straight, use keel 
 panel upper flanges, accessed by removing aft tunnel cover. 
 For rigging: Level placed on top of main rotor hub parallel with teeter bolt. Main 
 rotor blades are aligned fore-aft for lateral levelling, and teeter bolt is aligned fore- 
 aft for longitudinal levelling."

Production Basis,"Production Certificate No. 424WE dated October 25, 2010."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for 
 certification. In addition, the following FAA-approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual 
 is required: 
 R66 Pilot’s Operating Handbook and FAA Approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual 
 (RTR 661), dated October 25, 2010, or later approved revision."
NOTE 1,"A current weight and balance report, including a list of equipment included in the certificated empty 
 weight, and loading instructions when necessary, must be provided for each aircraft at the time of 
 original airworthiness certification and at all times thereafter, except in the case of operators having 
 an approved weight control system."
NOTE 2,"The following placard must be installed in clear view of the pilot: 
 “THIS ROTORCRAFT APPROVED FOR DAY AND NIGHT VFR OPERATIONS” 
 For additional placards, see the Rotorcraft Flight Manual. All placards required in the Rotorcraft 
 Flight Manual must be installed in the appropriate locations."
NOTE 3,"Information essential to the proper maintenance of the helicopter, including retirement time of 
 critical components, is contained in the Robinson R66 Maintenance Manual and Instructions for 
 Continued Airworthiness (RTR 660). Retirement times are listed in the “AIRWORTHINESS 
 LIMITATIONS” section."
NOTE 4,"Deleted as of March 10, 2015."
NOTE 5,"Any cockpit instruments installed by a 3rd party must be marked with limit markings and range 
 markings in accordance with Robinson’s marking scheme."

NOTE 7,"Exemption No. 9589, dated January 28, 2008, has been removed since Robinson Helicopter 
 Company was granted an Equivalent Level of Safety (ELOS) finding to CFR §27.695(a)(1), Number 
 AT14992LA-R-S-1, dated February 20, 2013. The exemption allowed a powered flight control 
 system without considering the jamming of a control valve as a possible single failure. There is no 
 impact to R66 helicopters that have been delivered or are in service."
NOTE 8,"R66 helicopters equipped with the G132 Cargo Hook installation may be operated at up to 2900 
 pounds gross weight when the portion above 2700 pounds is jettisonable load on the cargo hook and 
 the helicopter is operating at or below 7000 feet density altitude. See Cargo Hook Supplement to 
 R66 Pilot’s Operating Handbook and FAA Approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RTR 661) for 
 additional operating limitations."
