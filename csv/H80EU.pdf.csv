Import Requirements,"To be considered eligible for operation in the United States, each 
 aircraft manufactured under this Type Certificate must be 
 accompanied by a certificate of airworthiness for export or certifying 
 statement endorsed by the exporting civil airworthiness authority 
 which states (in the English language): ""This aircraft conforms to its 
 U.S. type design (Type Certificate Number H80EU) and is in a 
 condition for safe operation. The U.S. airworthiness certification basis 
 for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 21.29 and exported by 
 the country of manufacture is FAR Sections 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into 
 the United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the 
 agreement, to identify any required statements by the exporting authority on 
 the export certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for 
 procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these 
 documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of 
 Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for 
 imported aircraft. 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated 
 under FAR Section 21.29 exported from countries other than the 
 country of manufacture (e.g. third party country) is FAR Sections 
 21.183(d) or 21.183(b). 
 Certificates of Airworthiness under this Type Certificate may not be 
 granted unless approved passenger seating featuring upper torso 
 restraint is installed. 
 Note: The Maintenance Manual for the EH101-300 has not been 
 accepted by the FAA; therefore, this aircraft is not eligible for 
 4 
 FAR 21 including Amendment 21-61. 
 FAR 29 including Amendment 29-1 through 29-27. 
 FAR 29.351 Amendment 29-30. 
 Equivalent Safety Findings for FAR 29.903(b) and FAR 29.1303(g)(2) 
 Special condition no. 29-ASW-12 on HIRF. 
 FAR 36 including Amendment 36-14. 
 Civil Aviation Authority-United Kingdom (CAA-U.K.) originally type 
 certificated this rotorcraft under its type certificate number BR2. The FAA 
 validated this product under U.S.Type Certificate Number H80EU"
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable 
 airworthiness regulations (see certification basis) must be installed in 
 the aircraft for certification. 
 In addition a CAA approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual is required."
NOTES,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an National 
 Aviation Authority (NAA) Export Certificate of Airworthiness (Export C of A) 
 signed by a representative of the Civil Aviation Authority-United Kingdom 
 (CAA-UK) on behalf of the European Community. 
 The Export C of A should contain the following statement: “The aircraft 
 covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to comply with 
 the type design” approved under U.S. Type Certificate Number H80EU and to 
 be in a condition for safe operation."
Note 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment 
 included in certificated empty weight, and loading instructions when 
 necessary must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original 
 certification. 
 The certificated empty weight and corresponding CG location must 
 include total oil capacity of 22.43 U.S. Gal. (84.9 lt) at sta. 9074 mm 
 (357.24 in) and unusable fuel of 21.03 U.S. Gal. (79.6 lt) at sta. 
 7259 mm (285.8 in)."
Note 2,"Placards listed in the CAA approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual must 
 be displayed in the appropriate location."
Note 3,"Instructions for continued airworthiness of the rotorcraft are provided 
 in the following documentation: 
 - Document No. ED02P2llJTC Continued Airworthiness 
 Schedule and Airworthiness Limitations Manual 
 - Document No. EC02P002J Maintenance Manual 
 5 
 Service bulletins, structural repair manuals, overhaul and maintenance 
 manuals, which contain a statement that the document is CAA 
 approved, are accepted by the FAA and are considered FAA approved. 
 These acceptances pertain to the type design only.
