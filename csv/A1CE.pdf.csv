NOTE 3,"Operational Limitations 
 Spins: The airplane will not spin if orthodox entry is used, but will enter a spiral dive. Speed builds up rapidly 
 in a spiral dive, requiring high pullout loads; therefore, if a spiral is inadvertently entered recovery from the 
 spiral is to be initiated within two turns. 
 Entry: Stall the airplane with the control column hard back, power off, flaps up, carburetor heat as required 
 and with the nose about 15° above the horizon. At the stall, apply full rudder in the direction required to 
 spin. A slight rudder application immediately before the stall will assure the direction of spin. The airplane 
 nose will drop and rotate towards the applied rudder. When the wings are 90° to the horizon, apply full 
 aileron against (i.e. against the intended direction of spin). The airplane will go slightly inverted and enter a 
 normal spin. 
 If aileron against is not applied or applied too late, the airplane will enter a rapid spiral dive, and recovery must 
 be initiated by the second turn. If the full back stick is not applied and held, the airplane may spiral. Again 
 recovery must be initiated not later than the second turn. 
 If aileron is applied too early, the airplane will not rotate and merely remain in a straight stalled condition. 
 Recovery: ""THE AIRPLANE WILL RECOVER FROM ANY SPIN WHEN POSITIVE CORRECTIVE 
 ACTION IS TAKEN; SIMULTANEOUSLY REVERSE RUDDER AND ELEVATOR WITH 
 AILERON NEUTRAL. ALL CONTROLS SHOULD BE NEUTRALIZED AS ROTATION STOPS."" 
 Operational Limitations: (Model C23, M-1629 - Model B19, MB-747 and on) 
 Spins: The airplane will not spin if orthodox entry is used, but will enter a spiral dive. Speed builds up 
 rapidly in a spiral dive, requiring high pullout loads; therefore, if a spiral is inadvertently entered, recovery 
 from the spiral is to be initiated within two turns. 
 Entry: Stall the airplane with the control column hard back, throttle in idle position, flaps up, 
 carburetor heat as required and with the nose about 15° above the horizon. At the stall, apply full rudder 
 in the direction required to spin. A slight rudder application immediately before the stall will assure the 
 direction of spin. The airplane nose will drop and rotate towards the applied rudder. When the wings 
 are 90° to the horizon, apply full aileron against (i.e. against the intended direction of spin). The airplane will go 
 slightly inverted and enter a normal spin. 
 If aileron against is not applied or applied too late, the airplane will enter a raid spiral dive, and recovery 
 must be initiated by the second turn. 
 If the full back stick is not applied and held, the airplane may spiral. Again, recovery must be initiated not later 
 than the second turn. 
 If aileron is applied too early, the airplane will not rotate and merely remain in a straight stalled condition. 
 Recovery: “IMMEDIATELY MOVE THE CONTROL COLUMN FULL FORWARD AND 
 SIMULTANEOUSLY APPLY FULL RUDDER OPPOSITE TO THE DIRECTION OF 
 THE SPIN: CONTINUE TO HOLD THIS CONTROL POSITION UNTIL ROTATION STOPS AND 
 THEN NEUTRALIZE ALL CONTROLS AND EXECUTE A SMOOTH PULLOUT. AILERONS 
 SHOULD BE NEUTRAL AND THROTTLE IN IDLE POSITION AT ALL TIMES DURING RECOVERY."""
