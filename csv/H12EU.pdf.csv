 comply with FAR 29 amendments 29-15 through 29-20 except for FAR 29.1529 as 
 concerns Appendix A A29.4. 
 The Airworthiness criteria for Instrument Flight dated December 15, 1978 for IFR 
 Certification. 
 Ditching approval in accordance with FAR 29.801 except FAR 29.1415 requirement. 
 Equivalent safety findings: see NOTE 4. 
 Type Certificate No. H12EU issued December 1,1982. 
 Date of Application for Type Certificate: January 20, 1978."
Serial Nos Eligible,See Import Requirements.
Import Requirements,"A U.S. Standard Airworthiness Certificate may be issued on the basis of a United 
 Kingdom Certificate of Airworthiness for Export signed by a representative of the United 
 Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority containing the following statement: - ""The Helicopter 
 covered by this Certificate has been examined, tested and found to conform to the type 
 design approved under Type Certificate No. H12EU, and to be in a condition for safe 
 operation."" 
 Caution: The United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority notified the FAA that the 
 Service Difficulty information on the W30 helicopter may be out of date. For the 
 latest information on service difficulties prior to certifying a W30, please contact 
 the Rotorcraft Directorate, FAA, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Fort Worth, Texas, 76193, 
 telephone (817)222-5111, Fax (817)222-5961."
Service Information,"""Service bulletins, structural repair manuals, aircraft flight manuals, and overhaul and 
 maintenance manuals, which contain a statement that the document is CAA of the U.K. 
 and Northern Ireland approved, are accepted by the FAA and are considered FAA 
 approved. These approvals pertain to the type design only."""
Equipment,"The basis required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (See Certification Basis) must be installed in the helicopter for certification. Westland 
 Report No. WER141-30-00497 lists required and optional equipment for the helicopter. 
 In addition, the following item of equipment is required: 
 United Kingdom CAA - approved Rotorcraft Flight Manuals: 
 Series 100 RFM ref. WD6.2, approved December 1, 1982 
 Series 100-60 RFM ref. WD6.4, approved August 27, 1984 (12,350 lbs maximum AUW 
 weight) 
 Series 100-60 RFM ref. WD6.6, Revision No. 2, approved December 6, 1985 (12,800 lbs 
 maximum AUW weight) 
 There may be approved rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) amendments or supplements 
 issued after the original type certificate, that are required to operate the helicopter when 
 additional equipment is installed and/or when certain modifications are embodied. 
 The helicopter owner/operator should ensure that the correct approved rotorcraft Flight 
 Manual (RFM) amendments or supplements are incorporated in the approved RFM, for 
 the approved model."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including loading instructions and list of equipment included in the 
 certificated empty weight, must be provided for each helicopter at the time of original certification. 
 When changes are made to the helicopter which affect the weight and balance, refer to the Flight Manual 
 Weight and Balance Appendix for instructions."
NOTE 2,All placards indicated in the Rotorcraft Flight Manual must be installed in the appropriate location.
NOTE 3,"Information essential to the proper maintenance of the helicopter is contained in the Manufacturer's Westland 
 30 Series 100 and 100-60 Maintenance Manual provided with each helicopter. 
 Life-limited components and associated retirement times are presented in Chapter 05, Section 05-10-00 
 Table 2 of the Maintenance Manual, and must be replaced in accordance therewith. 
 For Rolls-Royce engines the life limited parts and accountability methods are identified in Rolls-Royce Gem 
 Engine Service Bulletin Numbers 6000 for Gem Mk.510 and 72-1 for MK.530. 
 The instructions for continued airworthiness, ""Airworthiness Limitation"" are presented in chapter 05, section 
 05 - 10 - 00 table 5 of the Maintenance Manual must be complied with and may not be changed without 
 FAA-approval."
