CG range and Datum,"The nose gear retraction moment is 18,600 in/lb. for Model 720-025; 
 and 14,500 in./lb. for the other 720 Models, and causes the C.G. to move 
 forward. The main gear retracts parallel to the wing reference axis; hence, 
 has no effect on the airplane C.G. 
 All stations noted in the Data Sheet are Body Stations unless identified 
 specifically as moment arms. Drawing 69-10819, defines body stations and 
 moment arms. For weight and balance purposes, datum is 70 in. forward 
 of nose (Moment Arm 0). Horizontal distance of datum to average wing 
 jack point is 810.5 in.

NOTE 1,"(a) 
 Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated 
 empty weight, and loading instructions must be in each aircraft at the time of original 
 certification and at all times thereafter except in the case of operators having an approved 
 weight control system. 
 (b) 
 The airplane must be loaded so that the C.G. is within the specified limits (See C.G. 
 Range) at all times with the effects of fuel use and movement of crew and passengers 
 from their assigned positions being considered. 
 (c) 
 The ""drainable unusable fuel"" is that amount of fuel in the tanks which is unavailable to the 
 engines and under critical flight conditions as defined in CAR 4b.416. This drainable unusable 
 fuel does not include the ""tank trapped fuel"" or ""line unusable fuel,"" which is the unusable 
 fuel retained in the fuel lines. The ""total unusable fuel,"" which includes the drainable unusable 
 fuel, tank trapped fuel and line unusable fuel, must be included in the airplane empty weight 
 or be suitably accounted for in the airplane weight and balance report. The total amount of 
 unusable fuel for all 720 and 720B Series aircraft is as follows: 
 (d) 
 ""System oil"" is defined as that amount of oil required to fill the oil system and tank outlets to 
 the engines. System oil and all hydraulic fluid must be included in the airplane empty weight or 
 be suitably accounted for in the airplane weight and balance report. See appropriate Boeing 
 document listed under ""Equipment."" 
 (e) 
 To preserve favorable wing bending moments, the following limitations shall apply: 
 All center tank fuel in excess of any included in the zero fuel weight must be used before the 
 transfer of reserve tank fuel. For 720 Series aircraft with 149,000 lbs. zero fuel weight, the 
 outboard reserve tanks must be filled when the airplane gross weight exceeds 180,000 lb. and 
 transfer of reserve tank fuel must not be initiated above gross weights of 185,000 lb. In all 
 other cases for 720 Series aircraft and for 720B Series aircraft, the outboard reserve tanks 
 must be filled when the gross weight exceeds 185,000 lbs. and transfer of reserve fuel 
 must not be initiated above gross weights of 190,000 lbs. 
 (1) 
 Fuel Loading Limitations 
 a. 
 Load fuel equally in main tanks 1, 2, 3 and 4 up to a total capacity of 36,000 lbs. 
 (for 720B Series and for 720 Series aircraft utilizing a zero fuel weight of 
 149,000 lbs.); 43,000 lbs. (for 720 Series aircraft utilizing 139,000 lbs. for zero 
 fuel weight); 29,000 lbs. for 720B Series aircraft utilizing the 156,000 lbs. zero fuel weight). 
 b. 
 If additional fuel is desired, load reserve tank. 
 c. 
 If the reserve tanks are full and additional fuel is required, continue loading fuel 
 equally in main tanks 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
 d. 
 If main tanks 2 and 3 are full and additional fuel is required, continue to load main 
 tanks 1 and 4 to required fuel quantity. 
 e. 
 If all main and reserve tanks are full and additional fuel is required, load center tank fuel. 
 OPTION: 
 Fuel must be loaded equally in the main tanks only up to a gross 
 weight of 185,000 lbs. or 180,000 lbs. for 720 series aircraft 
 utilizing the 149,000 lbs. zero fuel weight. Additional required 
 fuel must be added first to the reserve tanks and when full, then 
 equally to the main tanks and when full, then to the center tank. 
 NOTE: 
 Observing limitations above, center tank fuel may be substituted for 
 payload in any quantity up to the maximum allowable payload * or to 
 the center tank capacity, whichever is lower, provided the 
 difference in effect on balance is also accounted for. 
 * Maximum zero fuel weight less operating weight empty. 
 NOTE: 
 Tanks selected for flight may be loaded simultaneously. 
 (2) 
 Fuel Usage Limitations 
 Use tank-to-engine combination during all takeoffs and landing except as noted under 
 Minimum Fuel Go-Around. (See Airplane Flight Manual.) 
 The fuel in main tanks 1, 2, 3, and 4 must be used equally at airplane gross weights above 
 211,000 lbs. (Model 720B); 207,000 lbs. (Model 720). 
 Fuel reserves must be retained in main tanks only. 
 For 720B Series Only 
 Expend a minimum of 15,000 lbs. up to a maximum of 20,000 lbs. (total) of main 
 tank fuel for initial takeoff and climb to altitude. (Not applicable to takeoff gross 
 weights below 190,000 lbs.)

 therefore, replacement passenger seats aft of Fuselage Station 980 must be evaluated for compliance 
 with CAR 4b.358(c)."
NOTE 5,"Not applicable to Model 720-025. The alternate design condition (for the 720 Series only) differs 
 from the basic condition in that a higher zero fuel weight was selected (142,000 lbs. maximum). 
 Consequently, structure was substantiated at a reduced Vc speed (Vmo). 
 Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the Mmo speeds to the alternate Vmo speeds whenever the zero 
 fuel weight is greater than 139,000 lbs., and outboard reserve tanks are less than full."
