DATA PERTINENT TO ALL MODELS,
Datum,Front face of firewall.
Leveling means,Longitudinal fuselage longerons used as canopy rails.
Serial Numbers eligible,"A Certificate of Airworthiness for Export endorsed as noted under ""Import 
 Requirements"" must be submitted for each individual aircraft for which 
 application for U.S. certification is made."
Certification basis,"CAR.10 - CAR.3 effective 15 May 1956, including amendments 3-1 through 3-5. 
 Type Certificate No. 7A14 issued 21 November 1961. 
 Application for Type Certificate dated 19 December 1960. 
 The Direction Générale de l’Aviation Civile (DGAC) originally type certificated this 
 aircraft under its type certificate Numbers TC 13 and TC 22. The FAA validated this 
 product under U.S. Type Certificate Number 7A14. Effective September 28, 2003, the 
 European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this product on behalf of 
 France."
Import requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export Certificate 
 of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of the Direction Générale de 
 l’Aviation Civile (DGAC) on behalf of the European Community. The Export C of A 
 should contain the following statement: ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been 
 examined, tested, and found to comply with U.S. airworthiness regulations Civil Air 
 Regulation Part 3 dated 15 May 1956, including Amendments 3-1 through 3-5 
 approved under U.S. Type Certificate No. 7A14 and to be in a condition for safe 
 operation.’ 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness (or 
 equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of 
 Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. In addition, the 
 following is required: 
 (a) DGAC approved Airplane Flight Manual for the Models MS 894A, MS 894E, 
 Rallye 100 S. Rallye 150 ST, Rallye 150 T, and Rallye 235 E and Rallye 235C only."
Service Information,"Each of the documents listed below must state that it is approved by the European Aviation 
 Safety Agency (EASA) or – for approvals made before September 28, 2003 – by the 
 Direction Générale de l’Aviation Civile (DGAC). 
 • Service bulletins, 
 • Structural repair manuals, 
 • Vendor manuals, 
 • Aircraft flight manuals, and 
 • Overhaul and maintenance manuals. 
 The FAA accepts such documents and considers them FAA-approved unless one of the 
 following conditions exists: 
 • The documents change the limitations, performance, or procedures of the FAA 
 approved manuals; or 
 •The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this product’s U.S. type 
 certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. The FAA 
 may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to approve on behalf of the FAA for the U.S. type 
 certificate. If this is the case it will be noted on the document."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight and loading 
 instructions when necessary must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original certification. 
 The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of gravity location must include unusable fuel"
