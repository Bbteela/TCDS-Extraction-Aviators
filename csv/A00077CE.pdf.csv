 A CASA Certificate of Airworthiness for Export must be submitted for each

Import Requirements,"A United States airworthiness certificate may be issued on the basis of an 
 Australian Export Certificate of Airworthiness signed by a representative of 
 the Civil Aviation Safety Authority containing the following statement: 
 “The aircraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested and found

 FAA approved manuals; or 
 •The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this product’s 
 U.S. type certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93.
