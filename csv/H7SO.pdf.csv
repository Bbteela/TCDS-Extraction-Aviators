Certification Basis,"Part 21 § 21.25(a)(2), effective February 1, 1965, including Amendments 21-1 
 through 21-42. 
 Type Certificate No. H7SO for the special purpose of: 
 1) Agricultural operations under § 21.25(b)(1). 
 Note: In accordance with § 36.1(a)(4), compliance with the noise requirements 
 was not shown. Therefore, aircraft certified under this type certificate are only 
 eligible for agricultural operations excepted by § 36.1(a)(4) and defined under § 
 137.3. 
 2) Forest and Wildlife Conservation under § 21.25(b)(2) 
 Note: In accordance with § 36.1(a)(4), compliance with the noise requirements 
 was not shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this type certificate are only 
 eligible for dispensing fire fighting materials excepted by § 36.1(a)(4) and defined 
 under § 137.3. 
 3) External Load Operations under § 21.25(b)(7) 
 Note: In accordance with part § 36.1(a) (4), compliance with the noise 
 requirements was not shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this type 
 36.1(a) (4) and defined under § 133.1(b). 
 Any alteration to the aircraft for Special Purposes not identified above require 
 further FAA approval and in addition, may require noise and/or flight testing. 
 General Note: Any subsequent modifications to the helicopters type certified 
 under this Type Certificate are to have the certification basis for that 
 modification established under 14 CFR 21.101 published June 7, 2000 which 
 became effective June 10, 2003. Otherwise non-significant modifications are to 
 meet the requirements of 14 CFR 29 airworthiness standards, transport category, 
 Amendment 1, effective August 12, 1965 and 14 CFR 29.1529, Instructions for 
 Continued Airworthiness, Amendment 20, effective September 11, 1980."
Production Basis,"None. No helicopter may be produced under this approval. Each helicopter 
 must pass a conformity inspection in accordance with this TCDS, plus any 
 additional special instructions attached to the Request for Conformity, FAA 
 8120-10. In addition a check, by the type certificate holder, of the flight 
 characteristics in accordance with all applicable portions of Section II of the

NOTE 9,"Military to Civil or Military to Military engine changes are allowed provided the 
 replacement engine is of the same make and model as identified in this TCDS. 
 The replacement engine must have proper military records and have the 
 applicable FAA Airworthiness inspections accomplished."
NOTE 10,"UH-1B Only: Lycoming engine models T53-L-11 (S/N suffix “A”), T53-L- 
 11B and T53-L-11C are approved for use as alternate engines under this Type 
 Certificate. Engines identified in this note will be maintained on a 1200 hr. 
 (T53-L-11C, 1800 hr.) overhaul schedule and in accordance with the applicable 
 U.S. Army Maintenance, Overhaul and Parts Manuals, applicable to that engine. 
 UH-1E Only: The UH-1E model helicopter is eligible with a Lycoming T53-L-

NOTE 11,"For Models UH-1E / UH-1L / TH-1L 
 The T53-L-13B engines in these installations are rated to an output torque value 
 equivalent to 1400 SHP at 6600 RPM take-off and 1250 SHP continuous; 
 however the transmission is restricted to a maximum of 1100 SHP at 6600 RPM 
 (50 PSI torque). 
 The T53-L-13 and T53-L-13A engines are limited to 97% gas producer speed or 
 24,400 RPM. An aircraft equipped with the T53-L-13B engine is not limited by 
 this power plant restriction; therefore the pilot must ascertain which engine is 
 installed prior to start. Performance charts have been included in the Department 
 of the Navy Technical Manual NAVAIR 01-110HCA-1, “NATOPS Flight 
 Manual Navy Models UH-1E, UH-1L, TH-1L & HH-1K Helicopters” dated 15

 SHP continuous; however the transmission is restricted to a maximum of 1100 
 SHP at 6600 RPM (50 PSI torque)."
NOTE 13,"Torque pressure output by the engine torque sensing system varies with individual 
 engines. The calibration of this value is required on each engine and the value 
 corresponding to take-off power is stamped on the engine data plate."
NOTE 14,"Gas producer speeds as shown under “Engine Limits” are maximum permissible speeds. 
 The gas producer speed for rated power varies with individual engines and must be 
 determined during engine calibration and stamped on the engine data plate. The rated gas 
 producer speed shown on the temperature limit placard installed on the instrument panel 
 must correspond to the engine data plate gas producer speed. Gas producer speed limits 
 also vary with OAT in accordance with the schedule as shown on the Temperature Limits 
 (GO-NO-GO TAKE-OFF) placard on the instrument panel or Health Indicator Test 
 (HIT) results, as applicable."
NOTE 15,"Maximum permissible exhaust gas temperature varies with ambient temperature 
 as described in the “Operator’s Manual”. Check engine EGT by use of Health 
 Indicator Test (HIT) prior to take-off see Department of the Army Technical
