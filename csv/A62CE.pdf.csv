 FAA approved manuals; or 
  
 The documents make an acoustical or emissions changes to this product’s 
 U.S. type certificate as defined in 14 CFR § 21.93. 
 The FAA uses the post type validation procedures to approve these documents. The 
 FAA may delegate on case-by-case to EASA to approve on behalf of the FAA for the 
 U.S. type certificate. If this is the case, it will be noted on the document. 
 Each airplane is provided with the following approved documents:
