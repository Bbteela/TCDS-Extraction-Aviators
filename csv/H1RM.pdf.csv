 1. Agriculture operations under FAR 21.25 (b) (1) 
 Note: In accordance with FAR 36.1(a)(4), compliance with the noise 
 requirements was not shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this 
 type certificate are only eligible for agricultural operations excepted by 
 FAR 36.1(a)(4) and defined under FAR 137.3. 
 2. Forest and wildlife Conservation operations under FAR 21.25(b)(2) 
 Note: In accordance with FAR 36.1(a)(4), compliance with the noise 
 requirements was not shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this 
 type certificate are only eligible for dispensing fire fighting materials 
 excepted by FAR 36.1(a)(4) and defined under FAR 137.3 
 3. External load operations under FAR 21.25(b)(7) 
 Note: In accordance with FAR 36.1 (a)(4), compliance with the noise 
 requirements was not shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this 
 type certificate are only eligible for external operations excepted by FAR 
 36.1(a)(4) and defined under FAR 133.1(b) 
 Any alteration to the aircraft for Special Purposes not identified above requires 
 FAA approval and in addition may require noise and/or flight testing. 
 General Note: Any subsequent modifications to the helicopter type certified 
 under this Type Certificate are to have the certification basis for that 
 modification established under 14 CFR 21.101 published June 7, 2000 which 
 became effective June 10, 2003. Otherwise non-significant modifications are 
 to meet the requirements of CAR 7 airworthiness standards, including 
 Amendment 7-5, effective May 1962 plus special conditions for turbine engine 
 installations and 14 CFR 29.1529, Instructions for continued airworthiness, 
 Amendment 20, effective September 11, 1980. Also should consider that 
 military installed crashworthy fuel systems in some of these aircraft and should 
 require that to be maintained."
Date of Application,"September 29, 1978"
Production Basis,"None. No helicopter may be produced under this approval. Prior to adding 
 serial numbers to this Type Certificate, each candidate helicopter must undergo 
 a conformity inspection. The conformity inspection will be conducted in 
 accordance with a Type Inspection Authorization, Part 1, or request for 
 conformity that will include as a minimum, the inspections contained in the 
 FAA Rotorcraft Directorate Restricted Category conformity document dated 
 September 25, 2001 or later FAA approved revisions."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment for each special purpose as prescribed in the 
 applicable airworthiness regulations (see Certification Basis) must be installed 
 in each type helicopter for certification. UH-IB Standard U.S. Army cargo

 1520-210-23P (Parts Manual), installed and maintained in accordance with 
 TM55-1520-210-23 (Maintenance Manual), and operated in accordance with 
 TM55-1520-210-10 (Operations Manual)."
NOTE 1,"A current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in certificated empty 
 weight and loading instructions, must be provided for each aircraft at time of original 
 airworthiness certification and at all times thereafter. Refer to pages 12-4a and 12-4b of 
 Operators Manual (TM 55-1520-219-10), SJHUH-01-003 Report dated May 15, 2001.
