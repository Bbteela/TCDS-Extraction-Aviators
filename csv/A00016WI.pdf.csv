 Production Basis None 
 Equipment 
 The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations (see Certification Basis) must be 
 installed in the airplane for certification. 
 Data Pertinent to all Models",
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance information, including list of equipment included in certificated empty 
 weight, and loading instructions are provided for each airplane at the time of original certification. 
 The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of gravity location must include: 
 Unusable Fuel 
 39.80 lb. at +296.69 in. 
 Full Oil 
 58.32 lb. at +242.33 in."
NOTE 2,"Airplanes must be operated according to the FAA Approved AFM, part number 408FM-00 AFM Volume 1, 
 408NP-00 AFM Volume 2 Normal Procedures, and 408EAP-00 AFM Volume 3 Emergency/ Abnormal 
 Procedures (or later FAA approved revision). All placards required by either the FAA Approved AFM, the 
 applicable operating rules, or the certification basis, must be installed as specified for this Type Certificate 
 via Parts List 7800000, Airplane Assembly. A useful placard reference is the Textron Aviation Illustrated 
 Parts Catalogue (IPC). Any discrepancies identified between the IPC and an aircraft under inspection needs 
 to be reconciled using the previously stated parts list."
NOTE 3,"See Airworthiness Limitations Manual (Chapter 4) for inspections, mandatory retirement life information, 
 and other requirements for continued airworthiness."
NOTE 4,"Aircraft definition for Type Certificate is Parts List 7800000, Airplane Assembly."
NOTE 5,"Certification Maintenance Requirements (CMR) are found in Airworthiness Limitations Manual, Chapter 4. 
 Engineering approval of the CMRs is documented in the Textron Aviation System Safety Assessment 
 reports."
NOTE 6,"The maximum propeller shaft overspeed limit is 110 percent (1,870 rpm) in an emergency to complete flight. 
 100 percent propeller shaft speed is defined as 1,700 rpm and is the normal steady state operating limit. Gas 
 generator speeds up to 104 percent are approved for unlimited periods subject to applicable temperature and 
 other limits. 100 percent gas generator speed is defined as 37,468 rpm."
