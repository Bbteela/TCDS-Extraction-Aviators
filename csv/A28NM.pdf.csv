 A minimum restart capability after an all engines out scenario must be established under the following conditions using 
 procedures provided in the airplane flight manual (AFM): 
 a 
 During the take-off and the initial climb-out portion of the flight, the airplane should have the capability for the 
 flightcrew to restore engine power when the fuel source to the engine is interrupted. 
 b 
 During the high altitude portion of the flight at cruise speed and maximum altitude, the airplane should have the 
 capability for the flightcrew to restart from a stabilized windmill speed those engines required to maintain level flight 
 or should have the capability for the flightcrew to restart all but one of the engines and produce maximum continuous 
 thrust or power by an altitude of 15,000 feet. 
 c 
 During flight at speeds greater than the minimum flaps-up “holding speed” and at altitudes below 20,000 feet, the 
 airplane should have the capability for the flightcrew to restart with the engines at stabilized windmill speed those 
 engines necessary to maintain safe flight and arrest the airplane descent within a total altitude loss of 5,000 feet prior to 
 exceeding an airspeed of 300 knots.

 Note 
 In order for the FAA to make the finding that Airbus Model A320-216 aircraft that was produced before December 19, 2016 to 
 be registered in the US is in a condition for safe operation, the FAA certificating inspector or other authorized person must assure 
 the aircraft conforms to the Required Airworthiness Action List (RAAL) document number D000A5108/C00 Issue 2 dated 
 December 19 2016 
 Civil Aviation (DGAC) France or European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is the state of design authority for the 
 Airbus A320-216, to be required to correct unsafe conditions discovered on the original type design of the A320-216. DGAC 
 France and EASA issued Airworthiness Directives that require the accomplishment of these modifications and inspections to 
 (MCAIs). Based on these MCAIs the FAA has determined that for Model A320-216 aircraft produced before December 19, 2016 
 the airworthiness actions identified in RAAL document number D16037131 Issue 1, are required in the interest of safety and are 
 necessary for this airplane to be in a condition for safe operation. 
 Prior to issuance of a Standard Certificate of Airworthiness (C of A) on any Airbus A320-216 model aircraft produced before 
 December 19, 2016 all airworthiness actions shown in the RAAL document number D16037131 Issue 1, must be accomplished. 
 The airworthiness limitations associated with the type design of A320-216 must be included in the operator’s airplane 
 maintenance or inspection program. Any deviation from the RAAL must be approved by the Manager of the International 
 Branch ANM-116, FAA Transport Airplane Directorate.”

 Inflight Engine Restart 
 1 
 A minimum restart capability after an all engines out scenario must be established under the following conditions using 
 procedures provided in the airplane flight manual (AFM): 
 a 
 During the take-off and the initial climb-out portion of the flight, the airplane should have the capability for the 
 flightcrew to restore engine power when the fuel source to the engine is interrupted. 
 b 
 During the high altitude portion of the flight at cruise speed and maximum altitude, the airplane should have the 
 capability for the flightcrew to restart from a stabilized windmill speed those engines required to maintain level flight 
 or should have the capability for the flightcrew to restart all but one of the engines and produce maximum continuous 
 thrust or power by an altitude of 15,000 feet. 
 c 
 During flight at speeds greater than the minimum flaps-up “holding speed” and at altitudes below 20,000 feet, the 
 airplane should have the capability for the flightcrew to restart with the engines at stabilized windmill speed those 
 engines necessary to maintain safe flight and arrest the airplane descent within a total altitude loss of 5,000 feet prior to 
 exceeding an airspeed of 300 knots.

 Inflight Engine Restart 
 1 
 A minimum restart capability after an all engines out scenario must be established under the following conditions using 
 procedures provided in the airplane flight manual (AFM): 
 a 
 During the take-off and the initial climb-out portion of the flight, the airplane should have the capability for the 
 flightcrew to restore engine power when the fuel source to the engine is interrupted. 
 b 
 During the high altitude portion of the flight at cruise speed and maximum altitude, the airplane should have the 
 capability for the flightcrew to restart from a stabilized windmill speed those engines required to maintain level flight 
 or should have the capability for the flightcrew to restart all but one of the engines and produce maximum continuous 
 thrust or power by an altitude of 15,000 feet. 
 c 
 During flight at speeds greater than the minimum flaps-up “holding speed” and at altitudes below 20,000 feet, the 
 airplane should have the capability for the flightcrew to restart with the engines at stabilized windmill speed those 
 engines necessary to maintain safe flight and arrest the airplane descent within a total altitude loss of 5,000 feet prior to 
 exceeding an airspeed of 300 knots.
