 When the maximum weight is increased from 1500 lbs. to 1600 lbs., the service life limit may be prorated in 
 the following manner: 
 D = A + C - CA 
 B 
 Where ""A"" is the actual hours on the component prior to modification 
 ""B"" is the service life limit for the component @ 1500 lbs G.W. 
 ""C"" is the service life limit for the compinent @ 1600 lbs G.W. 
 ""D"" is the revised total prorated service life limit for the 
 component (including the time prior to modification)."
NOTE 4,"The model J-2 Gyroplane, S/N 10 and up, are eligible for a maximum weight of 1600 pounds when modified in 
 accordance with Aero Resources Service Bulletin No. 18A, dated 28 March 1973 or later FAA approved
