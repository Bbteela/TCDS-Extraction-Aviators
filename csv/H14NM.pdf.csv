 Takeoff and maximum continuous horsepower ratings are normally obtained at a 
 power turbine speed of 9,000 r.p.mRPM. (100% N2). 
 Total power for two-engine operation is limited to 7880 s. hp. (82% torque) for 
 takeoff and 6530 s. hp. (68% torque) maximum continuous."

 **When operating with power on, do not operate continuously below or above 
 100% Nr even though the normal operating range is 100% to 104% Nr. During 
 takeoff and landing, a rotor rpm range of 100% to 104% Nr is permissible to 
 reduce rotor induced airframe vibrations. This increased speed range is not to be 
 used in any of the remaining flight regimes."
Airspeed Limits,"Vne (never exceed) 120 m.p.h.MPH (104 knots) at 47,000 lbs. gross weight. 
 For airspeed limits at lower gross weights and variation of Vne with altitude 
 refer to Rotorcraft Flight Manual."
Other Limits,"The helicopters approved under this type certificate are done so under the 
 concept of limited exposure associated with escape from inadvertent ice 
 encounters, and are prohibited against flight into known icing. The helicopters 
 must be re-evaluated if certification to the General Ice Protection Airworthiness 
 Regulations is required."

 of: 
 (1) Forest and Wildlife Conservation operations under FAR 21.25(b)(2) 
 Note: In accordance with FAR36.1(a)(4), compliance with the noise

 Any alteration to the helicopter for Special Purposes not identified above require further 
 FAA approval and in addition, may require noise and / or flight testing. 
 General Note: Any subsequent modifications to the helicopter type certificated under 
 this type certificate are to have the certification basis for that modification established 
 under 14 CFR 21.101 published June 7, 2000, which became effective June 10, 2003.
