Import Requirements,"A United States airworthiness certificate may be issued on the basis of an Australian 
 Export Certificate of Airworthiness signed by a representative of the Civil Aviation 
 Safety Authority (CASA) containing the following statement: 
 GA200: “The airplane covered by this certificate has been examined, tested and found 
 to comply with the Master Drawing List GA200-01-02-01 Issue 1 and General 
 Specifications B14-00-31 at issue G or later CASA approved revisions approved under 
 U.S. Type Certificate No. A00001LA and to be in a condition for safe operation.” 
 GA200C: “The airplane covered by this certificate has been examined, tested and found 
 to comply with the Master Drawing List GA200-01-02-06 Issue 1 and General 
 Specifications B14-00-31 at issue B or later CASA approved revisions approved under 
 U.S. Type Certificate No. A00001LA and to be in a condition for safe operation.” 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for this airplane type certificated under FAR 
 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR 21.185(c). 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness 
 (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification 
 of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported 
 aircraft"
Certification Basis,"FAR 21.25 (a) (1), FAR 21.25 (b) (1), FAR 21.25 (b)(2) and FAR 23, dated 
 December 18, 1964, with amendments 1 through 36 “Airworthiness Standards for 
 Normal Category Airplanes”, except Section 23.562 (see letter dated April 5, 1995, from 
 Manager, LAACO) for the special purpose of: 
 (1) 
 Agricultural operations under FAR 21.25 (b)(1). 
 Note: In accordance with FAR 36.1(a)(2), compliance with the noise requirements was 
 not shown. Therefore, airplane certificated under this Type Certificate are only eligible 
 for agricultural operations excepted by FAR 36.1(a)(2) and defined under FAR 137.3. 
 (2) 
 Forest and wildlife conservation under FAR 21.25(b)(2). 
 Note: In accordance with FAR 36.1(a)(2), compliance with the noise requirements was 
 not shown. Therefore, airplane certificated under this Type Certificate are only eligible 
 for dispensing fire fighting materials excepted by FAR 36.1(a)(2) and defined under FAR 
 137.3. 
 Noise Control Act of 1972, which has been recodified into USC Title 49, Section 
 44715(a)(3). 
 See Note 6 for a finding of an equivalent level of safety to the requirements of FAR 
 23.1337(b)(1). 
 TC A00001LA issued on October 15, 1997. 
 Date of application for the Type Certificate (Restricted Category for agricultural use and 
 dispensing fire retardant only): June 17, 1994."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the airplane for certification. 
 In addition the FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual Report No B01-01-21 dated 
 October 8, 1997, or later approved version, must be carried. See Note 6."
Note 1,"A current weight and balance report, including a list of equipment included in the 
 certificated empty weight, and loading instructions when necessary, must be provided for 
 each airplane at the time of original certification. 
 GA200: The certificated empty weight and the corresponding center of gravity location 
 must include full oil (22.2 lbs. at -21.3 inches) and unusable fuel (15.6 lbs. in main tanks 
 at + 54.0 inches and 19.2 lbs. in header tank at + 11.9 inches). 
 GA200C: The certificated empty weight and the corresponding center of gravity location 
 must include full oil (22.5 lbs. at -21.3 inches) and unusable fuel (15.6 lbs. in main tanks 
 at +54.0 inches and 14.4 lbs. in collector tank at +62.2 inches)."
Note 2,"All required placards in the CASA Approved Pilot’s Operating Manual (for the FAA) 
 and the FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual must be installed in the appropriate 
 locations. 
 The following placard must be installed in plain view of the pilot: 
 “Restricted Category airplane for agricultural use and dispensing fire retardant only” 
 The following placards must be installed in plain view of the occupants: 
 A. “All occupants must wear an approved crash helmet when operating this aircraft”. 
 B. “The use of the second seat is restricted by requirements in FAR 91.313.”

 Airplane Flight Manual, Report B01-01-21 for the GA200 and Report GA200 B01- 
 01-26 for the GA200C."
Note 3,"Service life of structural components are listed in the Airworthiness Limitations Section, 
 Chapter 4, of the Service Manual. The Airworthiness Limitations Section was approved 
 by CASA (for the FAA). Revisions to this section must be approved by CASA on behalf 
 of the FAA. The relevant report numbers for these manuals are: GA200 – B01-00-21 
 and GA200C – B01-00-26"
Note 4,"Instructions for continued airworthiness must be completed and acceptable to the 
 Administrator prior to the delivery of the first airplane under the US Type Certificate.

Note 6,"GA200: Equivalent level of safety finding No. ACE-97-2. The fuel quantity indicators 
 and corresponding markings for the wing and header tanks provide an equivalent level of 
 safety to the requirements of FAR 23.1337 (b)(1). 
 GA200C: Equivalent level of safety finding No. ACE-99-04. The fuel quantity 
 indicators and corresponding markings for the wing and collector tanks provide an
