 equivalent level of safety to the requirement intended by the regulation. Exemption No. 6692, dated October 
 17, 1997, has been removed. This exemption allowed RHC to obtain certification of the design change 
 without considering the jamming of a control valve in the powered flight control system as a possible single 
 failure. There is no impact to R44 helicopters in service."
