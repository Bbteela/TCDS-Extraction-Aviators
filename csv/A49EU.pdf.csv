 “Import Requirements” must be submitted for each individual aircraft for which 
 application of certification is made."
Import Requirements,"The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on an NAA Export Certificate 
 of Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by a representative of United Kingdom Civil 
 Aviation Authority on behalf of the European Community. The Export C of A should 
 contain the following statement: ‘The aircraft covered by this certificate has been 
 examined, tested, and found to conform with Type Design approved under U.S. Type 
 Certificate No. A49EU and to be in a condition for safe operation.’"

 (Operations) Limited under the authority of EASA approved Design Organization 
 EASA.21J.047 - or for approvals made before September 28, 2003 under the authority 
 of JAA Design Organization Approval No. CAA.JA.02034 or Manufacturers CAA 
 Approval Ref. DAI/1011/55 - are considered FAA approved. These approvals pertain to 
 the type design only. 
 • BAE Systems (Operations) Limited service bulletins, except as noted below, 
 • Structural repair manuals, 
 • Vendor manuals referenced in BAE Systems (Operations) Limited service bulletins, 
 • Aircraft flight manuals, 
 • Repair Instructions. 
 Note: Design changes that are contained in BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Service 
 Bulletins and that are classified as Level 1 Major in accordance with either the 
 US/United Kingdom or US/EASA Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement Implementation

NOTES: (Applicable to both BAe 146 and AVRO 146 Models unless indicated otherwise),
NOTE 1,"Weight and Balance. 
 (a) Current Weight and Balance Manual including list of equipment included in certificated 
 empty weight and loading instructions must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original 
 certification and at all times subsequently. ""Weight and Balance Manual"" No. WBM 146 
 contains all the loading information required for each aircraft in its delivery configuration. 
 (b) The airplane must be loaded so that the C.G. is within the specified limits at all times when 
 all influences on C.G. position have been considered. 
 (c) The Weight and Balance Manual defined in (a) above quotes the quantities of unusable fuel 
 as determined by the critical conditions of FAR 25.959. Undrainable fuel, being that remaining 
 in the aircraft when all fuel drain valves are opened on the ground, is also quoted in the Weight 
 and Balance Manual."
NOTE 2,"All placards required in the Approved Airplane Flight Manual must be installed in the 
 appropriate location."
NOTE 3,"(a) Airframe Component Life Limitations, required Certification Maintenance Requirements 
 (CMR's) and required Structural Inspections are listed in the FAA Approved Airworthiness 
 Limitations Section (Chapter 5) of the BAe 146/AVRO 146 Aircraft Maintenance Manual. 
 (b) Engine life limited components are contained in Avro Lycoming Service Bulletin No. 
 ALF 502-72-0002, Revision 6, dated January 10, 1983 or later, approved revision."
NOTE 4,"Compliance with the fuel venting provisions of SFAR 27 is achieved by incorporation of the 
 components listed in Document Number HTD-N-46071SC0071."
NOTE 5 BAe 146 only,"Without Modifications HCM35040M and X the Auxiliary Power Unit has not been shown 
 with GTCP 
 to fully comply with FAR 25.1093(b)(1) and therefore cannot be considered essential for

 dispatch purposes when falling snow or freezing rain conditions exist. 
 With Modification HCM35040M and X embodied the Auxiliary Power Unit can be operated as 
 an essential power source for dispatch purposes in falling snow or freezing rain when the relevant 
 information is incorporated in the approved Airplane Flight Manual, Document No. BAE 5.1."
NOTE 7 BAe 146 only,"The Model ALF 502 R3A and ALF 502 R-5 engine are physically identical to the Model 
 ALF 502 R-3 engine and is eligible without additional installation instructions. However, the following 
 conditions must be observed: 
 (a) Any combinations of ALF 502 R-3 and R-5 model engines may be fitted to the aircraft 
 provided they are all operated at the model ALF 502 R-3 thrust settings and limitations. Any 
 combination of ALF 502 R-3A and R-5 model engines may be fitted to the aircraft and may be 
 operated at the model ALF 502 R-5 thrust setting and limitations. 
 (b) When four ALF 502 R-5 engines are fitted, they may be operated at Model ALF 502 R-5

NOTE 11 BAe 146 only,"Aircraft for Freighter Conversion 
 A BAe 146 200A/300A fitted with the BAe modification(s) noted below provides 
 provision for converting the basic BAe 146 200A/300A into the freighter configuration. 
 For 200A: 
 HCM 50200A 
 - Deletion of type certification basic features not 
 required on conversion to a freighter aircraft. 
 HCM 50200B 
 - Basic airframe changes. 
 HCM 50200C 
 - Dedicated freighter features. 
 For 300A: 
 HCM 50213C 
 - To prepare basic 300A airframe for 
 conversion to freighter role. 
 Freighter Aircraft 
 The BAe 146 300A fitted with the BAe Modification noted below provides full 
 conversion to an operational freighter aircraft. 
 HCM 50214S 
 - To introduce minimum standard for dedicated freighter 
 aircraft. 
 Modification HCM 50214S has associated content within approved Airplane Flight 
 Manual Document No. BAE 5.1."
NOTE 12 BAe 146 only,"Aircraft for operation to 31,000 ft: For aircraft fitted with BAe modification HCM 
 50043A and HCM 50043B, or E or F or for aircraft fitted with HCM 50043C, operation to a 
 maximum altitude to 31,000 ft in accordance with the Approved Flight Manual is authorized."
NOTE 13 AVRO 146RJ only,"On all AVRO 146-RJ Models, the engine is controlled by a fanspeed (N1) Schedule in 
 the Digital Flight Guidance Computer or the Aircraft Flight Manual. When Modification 
 HCM00020S is fitted to the RJ70A aircraft, the Schedule produces a thrust of 6,130 lbs at 
 sea level (static) and ISA +17.5ºC, (compared to 7,000 lbs without the modification and 
 HCM00020R fitted) which is the basis for the performance data in the Aircraft Flight 
 Manual."
NOTE 14 E3221 only,"Construction number E3221 is fitted with Modification HCM60346N which introduces 
 reduced Max. Zero Fuel and Max. Landing Weights and a reduction in speed VA to 240 kts 
 (IAS) with flaps retracted."
NOTE 15 E2208 only,"Construction number E2208 is fitted with Modification HCM20203B which introduces 
 reduced Max. Zero Fuel and Max. Landing Weights and a reduction in speed VA to 230 kts

NOTE 18,"In the original certification basis an equivalent safety finding (ESF) to FAR 25.773(b)(2) 
 amendment 25-23 was granted to allow for a non-openable first pilot window based on 
 certain compensating design features. FAR 25.773 (b)(2) was later amended by amendment 
 25-72 to delete the need for an ESF for a non-openable first pilot window provided certain 
 criteria are met (the criteria and BAe compliance with it are contained in FAA issue paper F- 
 1 dated July 8, 1998). Satisfying these criteria also establishes compliance with FAR 
 25.773(b)(2)(ii) and 25.775(e) as amended by amendment 25-72 and the certification basis 
 for the BAe/Avro 146 has been amended accordingly."
NOTE 19,"The certification differences between aircraft that meet the FAA certification basis (FAA 
 TCDS A49EU) and those aircraft that meet the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) 
 certification basis (EASA TCDS EASA.A.182) are limited to cabin pressure controllers, fuel 
 contents indicators, a change of MMO, associated placards and gauges and constructors 
 nameplates and flight manual. BAE Systems (Operations) Ltd Service Bulletins are 
 available to facilitate conversion of an EASA standard aircraft to an FAA standard aircraft 
 and vice versa. (SB01-07-20004A; SB01-37-20004B; SB01-35-20004C) Aircraft converted 
 from the EASA standard to the FAA standard must have an “A” suffix, in the aircraft model 
 designation, see table below and on the applicable placards and or nameplates to indicate 
 that the converted aircraft meets the FAA certification basis
