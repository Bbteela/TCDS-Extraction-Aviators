 NOTE 1. (a) Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated weight empty, and loading 
 instructions, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter (except in the 
 case of air carrier operators having an approved weight control system). Manufacturer's Master Equipment List 
 contains list of approved equipment in addition to equipment listed in this publication. 
 (b) ""System Fuel and Oil"" (Item 102), which must be included in the empty weight, is that amount required to fill 
 both systems and the tanks up to the tank outlets to the engines, when the airplane is in the level attitude. The 
 propeller feathering oil in aircraft incorporating Hamilton Standard propellers is not considered usable oil and is 
 included in the ""System Oil"". The nacelle oil tank capacities shown in this specification include only the usable 
 oil for which the tanks are to be placarded. All hydraulic system fluid (See Item 406) must also be included in the 
 empty weight of the airplane. 
 (c) The ""unusable fuel"" is that amount of fuel in the tanks which is unavailable to the engines under critical flight 
 conditions as defined in CAR 4b.416 and may be obtained by taking the difference between the ""total"" and 
 ""usable"" tank capacities shown under ""Fuel Capacity."" The ""unusable fuel"" must either be included in the 
 airplane empty weight or be suitably accounted for in the airplane weight and balance report. 
 (d) Structural Limitations on Fuel Loading and Usage. All fuel must be distributed equally on both sides of the 
 airplane. All main tanks must be filled equally first, then alternates. Fuel must be used in the reverse order from 
 fuel loading except for take-off, climb and landing, at which time the main tanks must be used. Not more than 75 
 gallons (450 lbs.) of fuel should be used from each main tank on take-off prior to changing to alternates. 
 Satisfactory alternate fuel loading and usage procedures have been approved and placed in the FAA approved 
 Airplane Flight Manual. These alternate procedures may be used in lieu of the above. 
 (e) Fuel dumping - Fuel dump valves (Item 105) must be installed for operation of the airplane at weights in excess 
 of maximum landing weight. Refer to FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual for limitations and cautionary 
 procedures to be observed during the dumping of fuel. When dump system (Item 105) is installed, the amount of 
 usable fuel remaining in the fuel tanks after dumping is as follows:

 The total undumpable fuel and oil must be included in the landing weight. 
 When Wright DA3 or DA4 engines are installed on aircraft originally incorporating DA2 engines and the power utilized 
 is greater than that approved for the DA2 engine, the standpipes in the main tank must be of sufficient height to result in 
 148 gallons of undumpable fuel in each of #1 and #4 main tanks and 158 gallons of undumpable fuel in each of #2 and #3 
 main tanks 
 (f) For the interior arrangement of a particular airplane, see approved Douglas Report SM-14762 (DC-7 and DC-7B) or 
 SM-19487 (DC-7C). ""Loading Chart and Actual Weight and Balance."" That report shows the location of all passenger 
 and crew member seats; location and capacity of all cargo and baggage compartments, buffets, storage spaces and 
 coatrooms; and location and capacity of lounges and lavatories for each of the different sleeper and dayplane 
 arrangements covered by the above-mentioned report. Lounges, lavatories, and baggage or cargo compartments must be 
 placarded for the capacities specified in the above report. The airplane must always be loaded within the C.G. limits 
 specified in this specification, accounting for crew and passenger movement, and use of fuel and oil. 
 (g) For interior configuration of DC-7 airplanes converted to cargo see approved Douglas Report SM-23562, ""Loading Chart 
 and Actual Weight and Balance for DC-7 Airplanes Converted to Cargo."" This report shows the location of all crew 
 member seats and location and capacity of all cargo compartments. Cargo compartments must be placarded for the 
 capacities specified in the above report. 
 NOTE 2. The following placard shall be placed on the instrument panel in full view of the pilot or when appropriate, the 
 instruments should be properly marked
