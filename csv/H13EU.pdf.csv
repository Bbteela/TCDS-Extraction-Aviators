 Type design changes to the MBB-BK117 C-2 that install Garmin 500H avionics equipment and limit operations to VFR only 
 have been approved. These type design changes result in a helicopter that AHD has named MBB-BK117 C-2e. EASA issued an 
 amended type certificate (EASA.R.010 dated April 17, 2015) that identifies the MBB-BK117 C-2e. In accordance with FAR 
 21.19, the FAA determined that the type design changes involved did not rise to the level that required an FAA amended type 
 certificate. However, the FAA does wish to recognize that helicopters with these type design changes exist, therefore the 
 designation MBB-BK117 C-2(e) will be used. See Note 12 for more information on the type design changes for MBB-BK117 C-"

Import Requirements,"To be considered eligible for operation in the United States, each aircraft manufactured 
 under this type certificate must be accompanied by a certificate of airworthiness for 
 export or certifying statement endorsed by the exporting foreign civil airworthiness 
 authority which states (in the English language): “The aircraft covered by this certificate 
 has been examined, test, and found to comply with the German LBA TC Number 3049 
 (or EASA TC Number R.010) approved under the U.S. Type Certificate Number H13EU 
 and to be in a condition for safe operation.” 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 
 21.29 and exported by the country of manufacture is FAR Sections 21.183(c) or 
 21.185(c). 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 
 21.29 exported from countries other than the country of manufacture (e.g., third party 
 country) is FAR Sections 21.183(d) or 21.183(b). 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United 
 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness 
 (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification 
 of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported 
 aircraft.
