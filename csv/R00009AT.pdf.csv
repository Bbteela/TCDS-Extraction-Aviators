NOTE 11,"This Type Certificate (TC) has been designated ""ABANDONED"". A “Notice of Intent To 
 Designate as Abandoned Certain Type Certificates Issued in the Restricted Category,” was 
 published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the Federal Register on August 8, 2003 
 (68 FR 47379). That Notice listed this TC. The FAA received no comments on the published 
 Notice. The FAA has been unable to contact this TC holder. Hence, the FAA has determined that 
 this TC holder is not complying with its Continued Operational Safety (COS) responsibilities. 
 Therefore, no additional aircraft will be added to this TC and no additional original airworthiness 
 certificates will be issued based on this TC. The effectiveness of this TC is limited to those aircraft 
 that received original airworthiness certification prior to the incorporation of this note (Date of 
 Incorporation, January 24, 2005). Subsequently, if the TC holder is located and assumes their COS 
 responsibilities, the restriction(s) imposed by this note may be lifted."
