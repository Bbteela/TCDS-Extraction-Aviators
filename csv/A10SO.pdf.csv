NOTE 1,"Current Weight and Balance Report, including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight and 
 loading instructions when necessary, must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original certification. 
 The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of gravity locations must include undrainable system 
 oil (not included in oil capacity) and unusable fuel as noted below:

 4800 lb., in the Restricted Category envelope at sea level under standard day conditions. Further weight 
 increases should not be accomplished in the field. 
 The Normal Category maximum takeoff and landing weight is 3900 lb. Since the hopper load is disposable, 
 landing in excess of this weight should not be required. If it is necessary to make a landing at weight over 
 3900 lb., the pilot must exercise caution to prevent structural damage to the landing gear and airframe. The 
 takeoff weight should be adjusted also, to suit the runway surface to prevent over-stressing the structure."
