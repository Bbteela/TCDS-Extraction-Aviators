 3200 lbs. Gross weight, landing 
 Vc = 105 mph Vne - 141 mph 
 Airplanes equipped with these wings are eligible for certification under CAR 8 only. For certification at 
 higher weights and speeds than those shown above, these airplanes should be flight tested in 
 accordance with CAM 8.10-3 and the maximum weight established in accordance with CAM 8.10-4 
 for the intended special purpose."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated weight empty, 
 and loading instructions when necessary, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification 
 and at all times thereafter (except in the case of air carrier operators having an approved weight control 
 system)."
NOTE 2,"Prior to original certification of any surplus military aircraft the following revisions must be made: 
 (These revisions are also covered in Boeing Airplane Company, Wichita Division, Service Bulletin No. 75-1, 
 A75-1, B75-1, E75-1, A75N1-1, D75N1-1, A75J1-1 (one bulletin). 
 (a) 
 The 0.040 inch thick aluminum firewall must be replaced, covered, or backed by 0.015 inch thick 
 stainless steel or 0.018 inch thick mild steel suitably protected against corrosion. As an alternative, 
 the back of the present firewall may be covered with a sheet 1/8 inch thick asbestos covered, in 
 turn, with 0.020 inch thick aluminum. The entire assembly should be securely riveted together. The 
 asbestos and second sheet of aluminum need not be applied in one piece. However, any joints should 
 be well matched and asbestos joints should not coincide with joints in the aluminum. 
 (b) A suitable stick or gauge for measuring the oil quantity shall be provided. 
 (c) 
 The baggage compartment shall be marked ""maximum capacity 60 lbs."" or as limited by pertinent 
 weight and balance report, if less."
NOTE 3,"Prior to original certification of any surplus military aircraft of the subject models equipped with an 
 electrical system, the following conditions should be complied with or electrical installations should 
 be removed: (These revisions are also covered in Boeing Airplane Company, Wichita Division, Service 
 Bulletin No. 75-1, A75-1, B75-1, E75-1, A75N1-1, B75N1-1, D75N1-1, A75J1-1 (one bulletin).) 
 (a) 
 Any unapproved position lights must be replaced with Federal Aviation Administration 
 certificated or approved lights. The wing lights on some airplanes are already of an 
 approved type. These approved lights are NAF-1021 and AN 3033 models. However, if 
 the AN 3033 lights have a streamlined glass cover, the sandblasted area on the inside of the 
 cover should be painted black or the cover should be replaced with a glass globe and a 
 streamlined metal cover which can be obtained from the light manufacturer. None of the 
 rudder light assemblies incorporated on these military airplanes is approved. 
 (b) A battery switch must be installed that will disconnect the battery from the electrical 
 system as near the battery as practicable. 
 (c) 
 If the battery switch is operable from only one seat the airplane should be placarded for 
 solo flight from that seat."
NOTE 4,"Jacobs R-755-7 engines used in Army PT-18 airplanes must be inspected and modified as follows, 
 prior to certification: 
 (a) 
 The rear main engine crankcase must be part no. 30068. If any other rear main crankcase 
 is installed it must be replaced. 
 (b) Inspect all gears and bushings in the engine starter gear train to assure that they are in 
 airworthy condition. Any unsatisfactory parts must be replaced. 
 (c) 
 Eclipse type 946 starters must not be used with the R-755-7 engine due to their excessively high 
 clutch setting. In addition, no inertia type starters with a clutch setting above 300 ft. lbs. should 
 be used with this engine."
NOTE 5,"Rigging specifications are as follows: 
 (Complete maintenance instructions, including detailed rigging information, may be purchased from the 
 Boeing Airplane Company, Wichita Division.) 
 Center section centering - With fuselage leveled laterally the center section is centered by hanging a plumb 
 bob over the outboard side of the bushing at the front spar terminal bolt and measuring the lateral distance 
 from the plumb line to the fuselage box tube. This dimension is normally 23"" plus or minus 1/32"" and 
 should be equal within plus or minus 1/16"" on both sides of the fuselage. 
 Dihedral 
 - Upper wing 1/2°, lower wing 1-1/2° 
 Incidence 
 - Upper wing 4°, lower wing 3° 
 Stagger 
 - 26-13/16"" plus or minus 1/8"" at strut point (spoilers on both wings 
 or on neither wing) 
 - 26-9/16"" plus or minus 1/8"" at strut point (spoilers on lower wing only) 
 Sweepback 
 - 0°"
NOTE 6,"Models with engines listed under Sections I and II are also eligible for NC certification at a maximum 
 weight of 3200 lbs. under the following conditions: 
 Airspeed limits 
 Level flight or climb 
 123 mph TIAS 
 Glide or dive 
 148 mph TIAS 
 Propeller limits 
 Static rpm, at maximum permissible throttle setting:

 NOTE: 
 Above aircraft with external configuration changes such as approved dusters, sprayers, etc., 
 listed under item 607, or similar, are eligible for NC or standard certification with the above 
 limitations unless otherwise noted."
NOTE 7,"The certification basis for these airplanes does not contain operating categories, i.e., normal, utility or 
 acrobatic, as listed in the current certification regulations. However, since certain of these models were 
 designed to perform and have demonstrated the capability to perform the acrobatic maneuvers not 
 exceeding the load factors listed below, the words ""acrobatic category"" are included so that those 
 persons concerned with these airplanes understand their capacity in terms of current practices. 
 Maneuvering load factors are as follows: 
 A75L3, 75, A75, B75, E75, A75N1, 
 B75N1, D75N1 and A75J1 
 +6.67 to -2.67 
 For the above reasons, the airworthiness certificate for A75L3, 75, A75, B75, E75, A75N1, B75N1, 
 D75N1 and A75J1 airplanes is to be issued in the acrobatic category."
