 Name change from Airbus to Airbus SAS August 2017. 
 To be considered eligible for operation in the United States, each aircraft manufactured under this type certificate must be 
 accompanied by a certificate of airworthiness for export or certifying statement endorsed by the exporting foreign civil 
 airworthiness authority which states (in the English language): This aircraft conforms to its U.S. type design (Type Certificate 
 Number A35EU) and is in a condition for safe operation. 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 21.29 and exported by the country of 
 manufacture is FAR Sections 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated 
 under FAR Section 21.29 exported from countries other than the country of manufacture (e.g., third party country) is FAR"

 Serial Numbers Eligible 
 A French ""Certificat de Navigabilite pour Exportation"" endorsed as 
 noted under ""Import Requirements"" must be submitted for each 
 individual aircraft for which application for U.S. certification is made. 
 Import Requirements 
 An FAA Standard Airworthiness Certificate may be issued on the 
 basis of a French ""Certificat de Navigabilite pour Exportation"" signed by a representative 
 of the Direction Generale de 'Aviation Civile (D.G.A.C.) of France, containing the 
 following statement: ""The airplane covered by this certificate has been examined, tested 
 and found to conform to the type design approved under Type Certificate No. A35EU 
 and to be in condition for safe operation"".Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to 
 verify eligibility for import into the United States of both new and used aircraft based on 
 the scope of the agreement, to identify any required statements by the exporting authority 
 on the export certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures 
 for coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to FAA 
 Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an 
 airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft. 
 Certification Basis 
 FAR 21.29 (a)(1), based upon France/German requirements of FAR Part 25 effective 
 February 1, 1965, including Amendments 25-1 through 25-20, plus Amendment 
 25-23 for Paragraphs 25.145, 25.1305, 25.1321, 23.1331, 25.1333, Amendment 25-24

 through 25.812, 25.853 through 25.857, and 25.1557; Conditions Techniques 
 Complementares as listed in DGAC documents 4080 DTA/M dated August 8, 1970, 
 3904 DTA/M dated July 20, 1972, and 2060 DTA/M dated March 30, 1973; 
 Corresponding FAA certification requirements are FAR Part 25 as detailed above plus 
 Special Conditions No. 25-52-EU-16, plus FAA Part 36 including appropriate 
 amendments (See NOTE 8). SFAR-27 through 27-3 (see NOTE 9). 
 Compliance has been shown with the following optional requirements: 
 Ditching 
 25.801 
 Ice Protection 
 25.1419 
 Date of Application: February 4, 1970 Type Certificate No. A35EU, issued May 30,

 DGAC originally type cerificated this A300 under its type certificate number N°72, 
 TCDS N°145. The FAA validated this product under U.S. Type Certificate Number 
 A35EU. Effective September 28, 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) 
 began oversight of this product on behalf of DGAC. 
 Based on 14 CFR § 21.29(a) for new import TCs, or § 21.101(g) for changes to TCs, 
 applicable provisions of part 26 are included in the certification basis. For any future 14 
 CFR part 26 amendments, the holder of this TC must demonstrate compliance with the 
 applicable sections

 NOTE 9 
 This exemption does not grant relief from the related operational requirements contained

 Models 304, 322, 324, and 325 airplanes under part 129 (U.S. registered only), 121 or 
 125 beyond the operational compliance deadlines as stated in §§ 121.1117, 125.509, or 
 129.117, (Fuel Tank Flammability) that person will be required to comply with those 
 operational requirements. Those operational requirements require a design change to the 
 center fuel tank that either reduces its flammability to the level required by § 
 26.33(c)(1)(i) or provides a means to mitigate the effects of an ignition of fuel vapors to 
 the level required by § 26.33(c)(2). See Exemption 10070 for background information

 GENERAL NOTES: APPLICABLE TO ALL AIRCRAFT 
 NOTE 1 
 WEIGHT AND BALANCE 
 (a) Current weight and balance report including list of equipment, entitled ""Aircraft 
 Inspection Report,"" included in certificated empty weight, and loading instructions, 
 must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter 
 except in the case of operators having an approved weight control system. Airbus 
 Report, ""Weight and Balance Manual,"" contains loading information for each 
 airplane and interior arrangement configuration as delivered. This report contains, 
 or refers to, information relative to location of all passengers and crew member 
 seats, location and capacity of all cargo and baggage compartments, buffets, storage 
 spaces and coat rooms, location and capacity of lounges, lavatories, and the required 
 placards in the passenger compartment. 
 (b) The airplane must be loaded so that the C.G. is within specified limits at all times, 
 considering fuel loading and usage, gear retraction and movement of crew and 
 passengers from their assigned positions. 
 (c) The weights of system fuel and oil, as defined below, and hydraulic fluid, all of 
 which must be included in the airplane empty weight, are listed for each airplane 
 in the Weight and Balance Manual specified in paragraph (a) above. 
 (d) System fuel is the weight of all fuel required to fill all lines and tanks up to the 
 zero-fuel point on the fuel gages in the most critical flight attitude, including the 
 unusable tank fuel as defined by FAR Part 25.959. (The usable fuel in the crossfeed 
 manifold lines, manifolds, and engine that is not part of the system fuel, must be 
 included in the total usable fuel to obtain correct weight and C.G. for takeoff). 
 (e) The unusable fuel is that amount of fuel in the tanks which is unavailable to the 
 engines under critical flight conditions as defined in FAR Part 25.959. This 
 ""unusable"" fuel is included in System Fuel as indicated in (d) above and need not 
 be accounted for separately. 
 (f) System oil is the weight of oil remaining in the engine, constant speed drive, lines 
 and tanks after subtracting the oil in the tanks which is above the standpipe (zero 
 gauge) levels. The engine oil capacities shown elsewhere in this data sheet 
 includes only the usable oil for which the tanks must be placarded.
