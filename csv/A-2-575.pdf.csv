NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight must be 
 in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter. If removable ballast is used 
 to stay within the specified forward limit, the following placard must be installed on instrument panel and 
 baggage compartment: ""When flown solo lbs. of baggage or equivalent must be carried in baggage 
 compartment."""
NOTE 2,"The following must be accomplished prior to original certification of the aircraft: 
 (a) Aircraft must have aluminum alloy wing outer panels and fuselage aft sections. 
 (b) Placard rear cockpit, ""Solo Flying From Front Seat Only."" 
 (c) Placard both cockpits, ""Intentional Spinning Prohibited"" and ""Caution: Unless Left Tank is Full, use 
 reserve or Right Tank for Take-off and Landing."" 
 (d) Placard baggage compartment: 
 ""Maximum Capacity 100 lbs. 
 With Both Seats Occupied lbs. Maximum"" 
 The latter weight to be determined per NOTE 1, the limiting factor being the rearward center of gravity. 
 (e) Mark fuel tank filler caps, ""Fuel capacity gal., 87 min. oct."" 
 (f) Mark oil tank filler cap, ""Oil capacity gal."" 
 (g) Mark instruments for approved operating limits. 
 (h) Provide oil measuring stick for oil tank. 
 (j) 
 In order for these aircraft to be eligible for night operation, it will be necessary that the following changes 
 be made: 
 1. 
 Remove the present red and green wing position lights and cover the mounting holes with aluminum alloy 
 plates. Install Grimes Model E wing-tip position lights and connect them into the present position light 
 junction boxes located near the wing tips. Also remove the present two rear position lights from the fin and 
 replace them with either Grimes lights No. A-4060 or Grimes lights A-2063 modified specifically by 
 Grimes for use on these airplanes. Either type of lights should have 15 candlepower lamps installed. 
 2. 
 Remove position light resistors and eliminate the work ""Dim"" at the position light switch. 
 3. 
 Relocate all electrical circuit protectors so that they are accessible to the pilot in flight. 
 (k) The cylinder head temperature gauge be marked to indicate a limiting temperature of 500°F. 
 (l) 
 On models BC-1A, AT-6 and SNJ-2 only, inspect fuel tank to determine whether gasoline can flow from 
 one compartment into the other. If so, the following placard should be placed adjacent to the fuel selector 
 valve: ""Refer to both fuel gauges to determine remaining fuel."" 
 (m) Add the following information to the engine nameplate: ""C.A.A. Spec. No.5E-2."" 
 (n) Fixed ballast not to exceed 33 lbs. may be installed at Station 240 to prevent exceeding the forward center 
 of gravity limit. Ballast weight installation must be approved and is to be placarded, ""Removal requires 
 weight and balance check."" 
 (o) On Model T-6G determine that the center wing flap is in the operative configuration."
NOTE 3,"Model AT-6 series aircraft certificated in the restricted category prior to October 11, 1950 for crop dusting may 
 continue to be operated with the following limitations: 
 AT-6 
 AT-6A, 6B, 6C 
 (a) Maximum takeoff weight 
 5870 lbs. 
 5830 lbs. 
 Maximum landing weight 
 5340 lbs. 
 5300 lbs. 
 Maneuvering speed at maximum weight 
 151 mph 
 151 mph 
 (b) The following placard must be in full view of the pilot: 
 ""Maneuvering speed at maximum weight not to exceed 151 mph."" 
 Each aircraft certificated on the above basis must be subjected to a flight test to determine that the installed 
 duster apparatus has no adverse effect on the flight characteristics of the aircraft. In the case of identical 
 duster installations in aircraft of the same model, the flight test need only be made to the prototype. 
 All original certification in the restricted category after October 11, 1950 must be in accordance with CAR and 
 CAM 8."
NOTE 4,"Prior to civil certification, it must be ascertained that Harvard aircraft manufactured in the United States 
 conform to the type design. Some of the known deviations from the original configuration are discussed as 
 follows: 
 (a) The mixture control must be reworked to standard American system, that is ""lean-aft, Rich-forward"". 
 A conversion to exact AT-6 system would be acceptable. Any other system would have to be evaluated. 
 (b) The long exhaust stack configuration should be modified to the AT-6 system. 
 Utilization of winterized stack would require evaluation with respect to: 
 (1) Carbon monoxide content in the cockpit from both the fresh air system, heat exchanger within the 
 stack and the stack proper. 
 (2) Detrimental temperature effects on the fuselage skin due to the proximity of the stack to the fuselage 
 as well as possible adverse exhaust back pressure. 
 (3) Determination that system was United States manufactured inasmuch as a foreign built unit would not 
 be eligible for approval. 
 (c) The use of Pratt & Whitney S3H1 engine is acceptable with Item 1 propeller. 
 (d) The acceptability of engine accessories must be determined. In this regard, Technical Order 00-25-29 
 (e) The use of a foreign manufactured landing gear is not considered acceptable, and therefore must be 
 replaced by an acceptable gear manufactured in the United States. 
 (f) The landing gear fairing and associated attachment hardware must be installed. 
 (g) The forward control stick has a four inch hand grip which differs from the standard straight stick 
 installation. If clearance from the structure appears adequate this may be considered acceptable. 
 (h) Electrical system deviations from the approved type design data must be appropriately changed and adjusted 
 satisfactorily. 
 (i) 
 Airspeed flap speed and cylinder head gage limits must be incorporated as in the AT-6 aircraft. 
 Other existing difference must be satisfactorily resolved with the local FAA Engineering Office prior to 
 certification."
