NOTE 5,"Model S-64A modified as described in Sikorsky Engineering Report No. SER-64182, approved June 27, 
 1968, for the purpose of United States Army use of a crane-type helicopter as a vehicle to transport cargo 
 and equipment, with or without combat crews, in a field Army. Included among the modifications are 
 changes to structure, systems and equipment, external cargo carrying provisions, and the incorporating of 
 two Pratt and Whitney JFTD 12A-4A engines with Hamilton Standard Fuel Control JFC56-4.
