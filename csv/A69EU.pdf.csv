 The Export C of A should contain the following statement: ‘The aircraft covered 
 by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to comply with U.S. 
 airworthiness regulations 14 CFR Federal Aviation Regulations Part 23, U.S. 
 Type Certificate No. A69EU and to be in a condition for safe operation.’ 
 Model Koliber 150A airplanes (SN: 0 393 0057 and 0 393 0058) modified by PZL 
 Modification Kit No. 1 are eligible for a Standard Airworthiness Certificate under 
 the U.S. Type Certificate. 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the 
 United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, 
 to identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the export 
 certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures for 
 coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to
