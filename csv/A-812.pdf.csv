NOTE 1,"A. 
 Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and 
 loading instructions when necessary must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original certification. 
 After original certification, the effects on weight and balance due to changes in equipment 
 and/or alterations must be suitably accounted for. 
 B. 
 Unusable fuel, which must be included in the airplane empty weight, is that quantity of fuel in system and 
 in the tanks which is unavailable to the engines under critical flight conditions as defined in CAR 04b.4221. 
 This unusable fuel includes ""system fuel"", which is defined as that amount required to fill the system and 
 tanks up to the tank outlets to the engine where the airplane is in the level attitude. The fuel gages are 
 calibrated using the unusable fuel level as the zero datum. The distribution of the total amount of unusable 
 fuel (Item 103(a).) is as follows:

 C. 
 ""System oil"", which must also be included in the airplane empty weight, is that amount of oil required to 
 fill the oil systems and tanks up to the tank outlets to the engines. The propeller feathering oil is not 
 considered usable oil and, when applicable, is included in ""system oil."" The oil tank capacities shown in 
 this specification include only the usable oil for which the tanks are to be placarded. Dipstick readings 
 indicate the amount of usable oil. 
 D. 
 The airplane must always be loaded within the C.G. limits specified in this specification, accounting for 
 crew and passenger movement and use of fuel, water injection fluid and oil. Retraction of the landing gear 
 changes the balance moment by 89844 inch pounds and moves the C.G. forward. 
 E. 
 For the interior arrangement of a particular airplane, see Section IV of the Airplane Flight Manual. This 
 gives the location of all passenger and crew member seats, location and capacity of lounges and lavatories 
 for each of the different sleeper and day plane arrangements covered by the above report. Cargo 
 compartments must be placarded for the capacities specified in the approved report. Passenger seats and 
 safety belt installations other than originally provided by the manufacturer must be of an approved type or 
 shown to meet the strength requirements of CAR 4b."
NOTE 2,"The following placards shall be placed on the instrument panel in full view of the pilot: 
 (a) 
 ""This airplane shall be operated in compliance with the operating limitations specified in CAA Approved 
 Airplane Flight Manual."" 
 (b) 
 On aircraft with Curtiss C644S-B302/1052-20C4-30 propellers installed: 
 ""Above 312 MPH (TIAS) do not operate between 1500 and 2000 RPM."" 
 (c) 
 On aircraft with Hamilton Standard 24260/2J17B3-8W propellers or with interchangeable blade models as 
 listed in Propeller Specification No. P-870, NOTE 6, installed: 
 ""Avoid continuous ground operation between 1500 and 2000 RPM."" 
 ""Avoid continuous operation in flight below 1750 RPM except 1400 RPM may be used for level 
 cruise but not for descent."""
NOTE 3,"A. 
 Fuel dump valves (Item 102) must be installed for operation of the airplane at weights in excess of 
 maximum landing weight. Refer to CAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual for limitations and cautionary 
 procedures to be observed during the dumping of fuel. 
 B. 
 When dump valves are installed (Item 102), the amount of usable fuel remaining in the fuel tanks after 
 dumping is as follows: 
 Outer Wing 
 (#1 and #4 Main) 
 220 gals. each 
 Inner Wing 
 (#2 and #3 Main) 
 270 gals. each 
 Alternate 
 (#5) 
 Not dumpable"
NOTE 4,"The limits for the TSB3-G, B-6 and B-7 engines are based on 100°F, carburetor air inlet temperature and 31 
 inches Hg. (absolute) exhaust back pressure. To maintain ""Maximum Continuous"" power under conditions with 
 higher inlet air temperatures and/or power exhaust back pressure, the manifold pressure may be increased up to 
 a maximum of 56 inches Hg. to compensate for the loss of power, provided neither 43 inches Hg. (absolute) 
 back pressure nor 130°F. carburetor air inlet temperature is exceeded."
NOTE 5,Structural Limitations on Fuel Loading and Usage:
For Model 377,"A. 
 The maximum airplane gross weight with dry wing, i.e., with zero nacelle oil, zero anti-detonant fluid, and 
 zero fuel in tanks No. 1, 2, 3, and 4, must never exceed 113,900 lbs. Dry wing gross weight must include 
 the weight of any fuel carried in the center section tank. 
 B. 
 For pay loads, bringing the airplane up to, but not exceeding, a dry wing gross weight of 109,300 lbs., fuel 
 in tanks No. 1 and 4 must be loaded to equal or exceed fuel in tanks No. 2 and 3, respectively, at any take- 
 off weight up to and including maximum. In flight, fuel quantities in tanks No. 1 and 4 must not be reduced 
 to less than those in tanks No. 2 and 3, respectively. 
 C. 
 For pay loads, bringing the airplane to a dry wing gross weight in the range between 109,300 lbs. and 
 113,900 lbs. (maximum), fuel may be loaded and used equally from all tanks as outlined in (B) above, 
 provided the take-off weight does not exceed 138,500 lbs. For take-off weights from 138,500 lbs. to 
 maximum, fuel in tanks 2 and 3 must not be loaded to exceed 5,150 lbs. (858 gallons) per tank unless tanks 
 No. 1 and 4 are full. In flight, fuel quantities in tanks No. 1 and 4 must not be reduced to less than those in 
 tanks No. 2 and 3, respectively. If there is a differential distribution of fuel at the start of the flight, fuel 
 may be used equally from all four tanks, or the fuel may be used first from the outboard tanks No. 1 and 4 
 until their quantity is reduced to be equal to the inboard tanks No. 2 and 3, at which time the airplane gross 
 weight will have been reduced below 139,500 lbs."
NOTE 6,"The ADI mixture shall conform to British Specification D-Eng. R.D. 2470, consisting of 40 parts water, 1 part 
 Shell Dramus B oil (or other oil conforming to British Stores, Reference 34A/193) and 60 parts methyl alcohol. 
 Mixtures of 50% water, 50% methyl alcohol; 40% water, 60% methyl alcohol; or 50% water, 25% methyl 
 alcohol and 25% ethyl alcohol may be used provided they conform to Pratt & Whitney Specification 509."
NOTE 7,"Tire inflation pressures shown under item 202 and Item 206 are those listed by the Tire & Rim Association for 
 the static load rating (main gear) and dynamic load rating (nose gear). Main gear tire pressures may be varied 
 with gross weight in accordance with the following: 
 Pressure, Inboard Tires = 
 Gross weight - 7 (+2) psi 
 1348 
 Pressure, Outboard Tires = Gross weight + 8 (+3) psi 
 1348 
 For all gross weights outboard tire pressure must exceed inboard tire pressure by 15 (+5) psi in order to insure 
 adequate airplane braking performance."
NOTE 8,"For Model 377, the engine limits, center of gravity limits and maximum weights shown under Section I, as well 
 as the performance limitations shown in the Airplane Flight Manual are applicable when the fuel grade 
 associated with a particular limit or set of limits is used exclusively in all tanks. For the B-7 engines only, those 
 limitations specified for grade 100/130 fuel apply. When fuel grades are mixed or interchanged the following 
 shall apply to aircraft with the TSB3-G or B-6 engines: 
 (a) 
 Fuel grades 108/135 and/or 115/145 may be used interchangeably or mixed in the same tank. NOTE 8 
 (b) 
 When fuel of grade 100/130 is mixed with grades 115/145 and/or 108/135 in any tank, the engine and 
 performance limitations applicable to the airplane for 100/130 grade fuel shall apply. 
 (c) 
 If the center section tank is filled with any proportion of 100/130 grade fuel, and the wing tanks contain 
 115/145 and/or 108/135 grade fuel, the engine and performance limitations applicable to the airplane for 
 100/130 grade fuel shall apply when fuel is used from the center tank. This will permit take-off and climb 
 on the higher grade fuel and enroute operation on the 100/130 grade fuel."
NOTE 9,"Ferry permits may be issued for the operation of a Model 377 airplane on which one engine is inoperative with 
 its propeller removed or feathered provided the operation of the aircraft is conducted in accordance with all the 
 pertinent limits contained in the applicable portions of the CAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual, including 
 gross weight and C.G. limits, and pertinent appendices and existing instructions governing 3-engine ferrying 
 operations."
NOTE 10,"The Model 377 may be dispatched with the automatic propeller feathering system partially or totally inoperative 
 subject to the weight and C.G. limitations contained in Section I, and the performance information given in 
 Section III C of the appropriate Airplane Flight manual."
NOTE 11,"The aircraft may be dispatched with the propeller reversing system inoperative subject to the performance 
 information given in Section III D of the appropriate Airplane Flight Manual."
NOTE 12,"For Model 377, in accordance with the agreement between the Department of Defense and the Civil Aeronautics 
 Board, all air carrier operators utilizing aircraft which have been modified under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet 
 Program, Part I, Phase II, may deduct the added weight of the military modification up to a maximum of 
 50 pounds for each aircraft so modified."
NOTE 13,"For Model 377, the fuel capacity of the main tanks No. 1 and No. 4 may be increased to 1950 gallons each by 
 adding 6 additional fuel cells to each outboard wing section in accordance with PAWA Engineering 
 Authorizations 45-212, 45-215 and 19-6070 and the referenced drawings therein. (Weight, left and right 
 installations +343 lbs. (566.0)). When these auxiliary cells are installed PAWA Airplane Flight manual 
 Revision No. 30 dated 12-24-54 should be provided in the airplane. Proper fuel management procedure is 
 outlined therein. Additional oil must be provided in accordance with the requirements outlined in PAWA 
 Maintenance Manual MS 31-1-7 revision dated 9-30-54. The total unusable fuel tanks No. 1 and No. 4 due to 
 the additional fuel cells is 55 lbs. The structural limitations as stated in NOTE 5, Items A, B, and C apply to 
 airplanes with the additional outboard fuel cells. In addition to the above structural limitations, it is required 
 that the added fuel cells by empty during landing.

NOTE 1,"A. 
 Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and 
 loading instructions when necessary must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original certification. 
 After original certification, the effects on weight and balance due to changes in equipment and/or 
 alterations must be suitably accounted for. 
 B. 
 Unusable fuel, which must be included in the airplane empty weight, is that quantity of fuel in system and 
 in the tanks which is unavailable to the engines under critical flight conditions as defined in FAR 25.959. 
 This unusable fuel includes ""system fuel"", which is defined as that amount required to fill the system and 
 tanks up to the tank outlets to the engine where the airplane is in the level attitude. The fuel gages are 
 calibrated using the unusable fuel level as the zero datum. The distribution of the total amount of unusable 
 fuel (Item 118(b).) is as follows:

 C. 
 ""System oil"", which must also be included in the airplane empty weight, is that amount of oil required to 
 fill the oil systems and tanks up to the tank outlets to the engines. The propeller feathering oil is not 
 considered usable oil and, when applicable, is included in ""system oil."" The oil tank capacities shown in 
 this specification include only the usable oil for which the tanks are to be placarded. Dipstick readings 
 indicate the amount of usable oil. 
 D. 
 The airplane must always be loaded within the C.G. limits specified in this specification, accounting for 
 crew and passenger movement and use of fuel, water injection fluid and oil. Retraction of the landing gear 
 moves the C.G. forward .6% MAC."
NOTE 2,Placards - See Airplane Flight Manual.
NOTE 3,"Structural Limitations on Fuel loading and Useage - Refer to ASI reports RGS-0-91-1, RGS- 0-91-2 and the

 and two parts by volume of purified water conforming to Allison Spec EMS 120A. Mixing shall conform to the 
 procedures of SAE SPEC AMS-3006B, paragraph 3.1, NOTE 1 and paragraph 3.13, NOTE 4."
NOTE 5,Tire deflection and pressure charts are shown in ASI 377 SGT Maintenance Manual.
NOTE 6,"Authorized fuel grades may be mixed in any quantities provided the mixture conforms to Allison Spec EMS-64 
 (Kerosene) or equivalent."
NOTE 7,"Ferry permits may be issued for the operation of a Model 377 airplane on which one engine is inoperative with 
 its propeller removed or feathered provided the operation of the aircraft is conducted in accordance with all the 
 pertinent limits contained in the applicable portions of the FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual, including 
 gross weight and C.G. limits, and pertinent appendices, FAA regulations, and existing instructions governing 
 3-engine ferrying operations."
