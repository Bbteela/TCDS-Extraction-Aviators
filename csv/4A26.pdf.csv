NOTE 1,"Weight, Balance, Fuel Loading and Usage Data 
 (a) 
 A current weight and balance report, including list of equipment considered as part of the certificated empty 
 weight, and loading instructions must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times 
 thereafter except in the case of operators having an approved weight control system. 
 (b) 
 The airplane must be loaded so the C.G. is within the specified limits at all times with the effects of fuel use 
 and movement of crew and passengers from their assigned positions being considered. 
 (c) 
 The ""drainable unusable fuel"" is that amount of fuel in the tanks which is unavailable to the engines under 
 critical flight conditions as defined in CAR 4b.416. This drainable unusable fuel does not include the ""tank 
 trapped fuel"" or ""line unusable fuel"", which is the unusable fuel retrained in the fuel feed and fuel dump lines. 
 The ""total unusable fuel"" and line unusable fuel must be included in the airplane empty weight or be suitably 
 accounted for in the airplane weight and balance report. The total amount of unusable fuel (in gallons) is as

 ""System oil"" is defined as that amount of oil required to fill the oil system and tanks to the tank outlets to 
 the engines. System oil and all hydraulic fluid must be included in the airplane empty weight or be suitably 
 accounted for in the airplane weight and balance report. See appropriate Being document listed under NOTE 14. 
 (e) 
 Fuel capacity and usage procedures are dictated by structural design. To preserve favorable wing bending 
 moments, the following shall apply: 
 FUEL LOADING LIMITATIONS 
 For 707-300/-400 Series 
 1. 
 Load main tanks 1, 2, 3, and 4 equally. 
 2. 
 If main tanks 1 and 4 are full and additional fuel is required, continue to load main tanks 2 and 3 to 
 required fuel quantity. 
 3. 
 If main tanks 1, 2, 3, and 4 are full and additional fuel is required, load outboard reserve tanks. 
 NOTE: 
 For fuel loading flexibility, outboard reserve fuel may be carried when main tanks are less than 
 full; however, outboard reserve tanks and main tanks must always be full when center wing fuel 
 is loaded in excess of any included in maximum zero fuel weight. 
 4. 
 If all main and outboard reserve tanks are full and additional fuel is required, load center wing tank to 
 required fuel quantity. 
 NOTE: 
 Center wing tank fuel may be substituted for payload in any quantity up to the maximum allowable 
 payload or to the center wing tank capacity, whichever is lower. 
 NOTE: 
 Tanks selected for flight may be loaded simultaneously. 
 NOTE: 
 For 707-321 aircraft 
 If partial loading of the reserve tanks is not desired, reserve tanks may be full and main tanks 2 
 and 3 off-loaded by no more than 4,800 lb. total. 
 For 707-300B and 707-300C Series 
 Load inboard main, outboard main and reserve tanks so that the resulting fuel load is symmetrical. 
 Interpolate between steps for intermediate fuel loads.
