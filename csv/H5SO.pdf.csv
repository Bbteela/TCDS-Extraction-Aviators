 (b) This helicopter must be operated in accordance with the restricted category limitations of FAR 91.39 
 and with the limitations noted in U.S. Army TM 55-1520-219-10. 
 (c) Standard U.S. Army Cargo Suspension Installation 204-070-529-5; 204-070-529-1; 204-070-529-3; or

Note 3,"Prior to civil airworthiness certification the following must be accomplished. 
 (a) International Helicopters, Inc. Report IHI 101, dated 5/7/84, must be complied with. 
 (b) If necessary for the purpose of weight and balance, relocation of battery to station (+5.5) should be 
 accomplished in accordance with International Helicopters, Inc. Report IHI 301, dated 5/7/84. 
 (c) FAA Airworthiness Directives for all Bell 204 (UH-1B) series aircraft and Lycoming engines T53-L-11

 replacement time shall be in accordance with TBO/Replacement schedule found in TM 55-1520-219-20, 
 unless superseded by appropriate Airworthiness Directives."
NOTE 5,Component life limits to be per U.S. Army TM 55-1520-219-20.
NOTE 6,"Torque pressure output by engine torque sensing system varies with individual engines. A calibration of this 
 value is required on each engine and the value corresponding to take-off power is stamped on the engine data 
 plate."
NOTE 7,"Gas producer speed as shown under ""Engine Limits"" are maximum permissible speeds. The gas producer 
 speed for rated power output varies with individual engines and must be determined during engine 
 calibration and stamped on the engine data plate. The rated gas producer speed shown on the instrument 
 panel must correspond to the engine data plate gas producer speed. Gas producer speed limits also vary with 
 OAT in accordance with the schedule as shown in the temperature in Limit (Go-No-Go Take-Off) placard on 
 the instrument panel."
NOTE 8,"Maximum permissible exhaust gas temperature varies with ambient temperature as described in the 
 Operation's Manual. Check engine EGT by use of Health Indicator Test (HIT) prior to take-off. (See TM 
 55-1520-219-10 and HIT EGT Log for aircraft)"
NOTE 9,"This Type Certificate (TC) has been designated ""ABANDONED"". A “Notice of Intent To Designate as 
 Abandoned Certain Type Certificates Issued in the Restricted Category,” was published by the Federal 
 Aviation Administration (FAA) in the Federal Register on August 8, 2003 (68 FR 47379). That Notice listed 
 this TC. The FAA received no comments on the published Notice. The FAA has been unable to contact this 
 TC holder. Hence, the FAA has determined that this TC holder is not complying with its Continued 
 Operational Safety (COS) responsibilities. Therefore, no additional aircraft will be added to this TC and no 
 additional original airworthiness certificates will be issued based on this TC. The effectiveness of this TC is 
 limited to those aircraft that received original airworthiness certification prior to the incorporation of this 
 note (Date of Incorporation, January 24, 2005). Subsequently, if the TC holder is located and assumes their 
 COS responsibilities, the restriction(s) imposed by this note may be lifted."
