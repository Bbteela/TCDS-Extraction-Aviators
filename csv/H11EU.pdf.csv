 The FAA can issue a U.S. airworthiness certificate based on a National AviationAuthority (NAA) Export Certificate of 
 Airworthiness (Export C of A) signed by 
 a representative of the French Generale de l’Aviation Civile (DGAC) on behalf 
 of the European Community. 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the 
 United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, 
 to identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the export 
 certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and for procedures for 
 coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to 
 FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements for 
 issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft. 
 The Export C of A should contain the following statement: “The aircraft 
 covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to comply with 
 the type design approved under U.S. Type Certificate Number H11EU and to be 
 in a condition for safe operation.”"
