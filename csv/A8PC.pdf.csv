Certification basis,"FAR 21.29, FAR Part 23 effective February 1, 1965, including Amendments 23-1 through 23-14 
 inclusive and Special Conditions No. 23-78-PC-1 issued by FAA Headquarters, Washington, 
 D.C., on August 12, 1977, and as amended on March 17, 1980, to include the Fuji Model 710 
 airplane. Compliance has also been shown with FAR 36 noise requirements. Satisfactory finding 
 under the Noise Control Act of 1972 completed February 17, 1977. Negative Environmental 
 Declaration Statement prepared February 4, 1977. Date of Application for Type Certificate 
 July 29, 1974. Type Certificate A8PC issued September 30, 1977 for the Model 700 and 
 amended on April 1, 1980 to include the Model 710."
Import requirements,"A U.S. Standard Certificate of Airworthiness may be issued on the basis of a Japanese Certificate 
 of Airworthiness for Export signed by an authorized representative of the Japan Civil Aviation 
 Bureau containing the following statement: 
 ""The airplane covered by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to conform to the 
 type design approved under U.S. Type Certificate A8PC and to be in a condition for safe 
 operation."" 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United States of 
 both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any required 
 statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent 
 document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these 
 documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements 
 for issuance of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft."
Service information,"Information essential for the proper maintenance of the airplane is contained in Fuji Maintenance 
 Manual: 
 FSD-E1864 for Model 700 
 FSD-E1958 for Model 710"
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for airworthiness certification. 
 Appendix C to the JCAB Approved Airplane Flight Manual identifies the required and 
 optional equipment approved by the JCAB for each airplane. The Master Equipment List, 
 Fuji Report FSD-E1955, identifies all required and optional equipment for the Models 700 
 and 710 airplane. A copy of this document is retained at the FAA, Pacific-Asia Region, 
 Engineering and Manufacturing District Office. 
 In addition, the following items of equipment are required:

NOTE 1,"(a) 
 Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in 
 the certificated empty weight must be in each aircraft at the time of original 
 airworthiness certification and at all times thereafter. The weight and balance 
 computations are included as Appendix B to the JCAB Approved Airplane Flight 
 Manual. 
 (b) 
 The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of gravity location must 
 include undrainable oil and unusable fuel as follows:
