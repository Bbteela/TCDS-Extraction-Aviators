 States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any 
 required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness 
 (or equivalent document), and for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity 
 statements on these documents. Refer to FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification
