 NOTE 8 
 Initial Type Certification Data Sheet No. H1NE for Model S-76A was not published. No airworthiness 
 certificates were issued, based on Data Sheet No. H1NE (No Revision). 
 NOTE 9 
 Model S-76A helicopters have been approved for the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA). This LBA configuration 
 must include a modification in accordance with Sikorsky Aircraft Drawing No. 76080-55007, Kit 
 Modification, LBA, PL Sheet 1 of 1, Rev (-), FD Sheet 1 of 1, Rev (-). This is an LBA special requirement 
 and is not approved for FAA airworthiness certification. 
 NOTE 10 
 Model S-76A: When operated at gross weights above 10,300 pounds, the helicopter must comply with 
 Revision 14 of the Airworthiness Limitations section, dated May 14, 1985, or subsequent FAA-approved 
 revisions of the Airworthiness Limitations and Inspection Requirements Manual SA 4047-76-2-1. 
 Model S-76B: All helicopters must comply with Airworthiness Limitations section, dated June 7, 1988, or 
 subsequent FAA-approved revisions of Airworthiness Limitations and Inspection Requirements Manual SA 
 4047-76B-2-1.

 NOTE 11 
 Model S-76A: Alternate engine installations with Turbomeca Arriel 1S or 1S1 engines are approved under 
 STC SH568NE (not in mixed engine configurations). 
 NOTE 12 
 Emissions control device Kit Part Number 76070-30603-011, installed in accordance with CSN 76-192, is 
 approved for installation on the Model S-76C helicopter with the Turbomeca Arriel 1S1 engine installation. 
 This device prevents the intentional discharge into the atmosphere of liquid fuel from the fuel nozzle 
 manifolds resulting from the process of engine shutdown following normal flight or ground operations. The 
 Model S-76B, and Model S-76C helicopter with Turbomeca Arriel 2S1 and 2S2 engines and the Model 
 S-76D with Pratt & Whitney Canada PW210S engines, without modification preclude the intentional 
 discharge into the atmosphere of liquid fuel from the nozzle manifolds resulting from the process of engine 
 shutdown. 
 NOTE 13 
 The use of the 30 minute power rating requires Supplement No. 12 to the Model S76C Rotorcraft Flight 
 Manual, document no. SA 4047-76C-10, or document no. SA 4047-76C-14. Approved procedures for the use 
 of the 30 minute power rating for the Arriel 2S2 engine configuration must be published in the Model S76C 
 Rotorcraft Flight Manual, document no. SA 4047-76C-15 prior to the use of this rating. Engine Airworthiness 
 Limitations requirements are as specified in Type Certificate Data Sheet No. E00054EN. For the Model S- 
 76D, use of the 30 minute power rating is addressed in Rotorcraft Flight Manual SA S76D-RFM-000; Engine 
 Airworthiness Limitations requirements are as specified in Type Certificate Data Sheet No. E00083EN. 
 NOTE 14 
 The Model S-76B (Pratt & Whitney PT6B-36 engine) and Model S-76C (Turbomeca Arriel 2S1 and Arriel 
 2S2 engines) rotorcraft installations employ electronic engine controls commonly named Full-Authority 
 Digital Electronic Controls (FADEC), and are recognized to be potentially more susceptible to 
 electromagnetic interference (EMI) than rotorcraft containing non-electronic controls. EMI may be the result 
 of radiated or conducted interference. For this reason, aircraft modifications that add or change systems that 
 have the potential for EMI must be either qualified to an FAA acceptable standard or tested at the time of 
 installation for interference to the FADEC. This type of testing must employ the particular FADEC’s internal 
 diagnostic monitoring equipment as well as external diagnostic monitoring equipment, and must be FAA 
 approved. 
 The Model S-76D (Pratt & Whitney Canada PW210S engines) rotorcraft employs electronic engine controls 
 that are recognized to be more susceptible to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) than manual (non- 
 electronic) controls used on other rotorcraft. EMI may be the result of radiated or conducted interference. For 
 this reason, modifications that add or change systems that have the potential for EMI, must either be qualified 
 to an FAA acceptable standard or tested at the time of installation for interference to the engine controls. This 
 type of testing must employ the particular engine control’s diagnostic techniques and external diagnostic 
 techniques. This testing must be accomplished in accordance with an FAA Engineering approved alternate 
 test plan. 
 NOTE 15 
 1-pilot IFR is approved for Models S-76A, S-76B, S-76C, and S-76D when appropriately equipped and 
 operating in accordance with a flight manual or flight manual supplement that allows such operation. For
