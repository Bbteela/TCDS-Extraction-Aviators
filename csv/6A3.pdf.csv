 NOTE 1. (a) Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated weight empty, and 
 loading instructions, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all times thereafter 
 (except in the case of air carrier operators having an approved weight control system). Manufacturer's Master 
 Equipment List contains list of approved equipment in addition to equipment listed in this specification. 
 (b) ""System Fuel and Oil"" (Item 103), which must be included in the empty weight, is that amount required to fill 
 both systems and the tanks up to the tank outlets to the engines, when the airplane is in the level attitude. The 
 propeller feathering oil in aircraft incorporating Hamilton Standard propellers is not considered usable oil and is 
 included in the ""System Oil"". The nacelle oil tank capacities shown in this specification include only the usable 
 oil for which the tanks are to be placarded. All hydraulic system fluid (Item 605) must also be included in the 
 empty weight of the airplane. 
 (c) The ""unusable fuel"" is that amount of fuel in the tanks which is unavailable to the engines under critical flight 
 conditions as defined in CAR 4b.416 and may be obtained by taking the difference between the ""total"" and 
 ""usable"" tank capacities shown under ""Fuel Capacity."" The ""unusable fuel"" must either be 
 included in the airplane empty weight or be suitably accounted for in the airplane weight and balance report. 
 (d) Structural Limitations on Fuel Loading and Usage. All fuel must be distributed equally on both sides of the 
 airplane. All main tanks must be filled equally first, then alternates, then auxiliaries (ten wing tank airplanes). 
 Fuel must be used in the reverse order from fuel loading except for take-off, climb and landing, at which time 
 the main tanks must be used. Satisfactory alternate fuel loading and usage procedures have been approved and 
 placed in the Approved Airplane Flight Manual. These alternate procedures may be used in lieu of the above. 
 (e) Fuel dumping. Fuel dump valves (Item 102 must be installed for operation of the airplane at weights in excess 
 maximum landing weight. Refer to FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual for limitations and cautionary

 ADI Fluid"" gross weight used in loading the airplane must be reduced by an amount sufficient to insure that the 
 maximum landing weight will not be exceeded after the fuel is dumped. 
 (f) When the oil transfer tank is installed in the wing fillet, the weight of oil carried in that tank plus the system oil 
 (Item 103(c)) must be included in the Zero Fuel, Oil and ADI Fluid gross weight. 
 (g) For the interior arrangement of a particular airplane, see approved Douglas Report SM-13977, ""Loading Chart

 capacity of all cargo compartments, and the load restrictions on the floor and wall cargo tie down fittings. 
 Cargo compartment must be placarded for the capacities specified in the above report. The airplane must 
 always be loaded within the C.G. limits shown in this specification, accounting for crew movement and use of 
 fuel, oil, and ADI fluid. 
 NOTE 2. The following placard shall be placed on the instrument panel in full view of the pilot: 
 (a) ""This airplane shall be operated in compliance with the operating limitations specified in the FAA Approved 
 Airplane Flight Manual.""

 CB-16 engines, Item 101(c), P&W LR-2800-52W engines. Item 101(e), P&W R-2800-83AM5 engines or Item 
 101(g) P&W Double Wasps CB-3 engines, the prop governors must be reset prior to take-off in order to limit the dry

 Conformity for each individual aircraft, listing all non-conformities at the time of delivery to the military 
 services is on file in that office. The non-conformities vary from time to time, therefore, the above items may

 NOTE 6: The following table lists the maximum zero fuel, oil and ADI fluid, landing and take-off weights of the various 8 and 
 10 wing fuel tank aircraft as they are limited by structural strength. Although an aircraft may be eligible, from a 
 structural standpoint, for certain take-off weights, the take-off weight may be limited from a performance standpoint 
 due to the propeller and engine combination that is installed, the flap setting used and whether water-alcohol injection 
 is used to increase the take-off power. Therefore, the table of take-off weights under maximum weights should also 
 be adhered to in determining the maximum permissible take-off weight of various aircraft.
