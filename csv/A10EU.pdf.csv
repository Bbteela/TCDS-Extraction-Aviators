 Italy 
 To be considered eligible for operation in the United States, each aircraft manufactured under this type certificate must be 
 accompanied by a certificate of airworthiness for export or certifying statement endorsed by the exporting foreign civil 
 airworthiness authority which states (in the English language): This aircraft conforms to its U.S. type design (Type Certificate 
 Number A10EU) and is in a condition for safe operation. 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 21.29 and exported by the country of 
 manufacture is FAR Sections 21.183(c) or 21.185(c). 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft type certificated under FAR Section 21.29 exported from countries other 
 than the country of manufacture (e.g., third party country) is FAR Sections 21.183(d) or 21. 183(b). 
 Notwithstanding that the FAR referenced in the above paragraph does not specifically address or require a foreign civil 
 airworthiness authority certification, such certification is the only practical way for an applicant to show, and the Federal 
 Aviation Administration (FAA) to find conformity to the FAA-approved type design and condition for safe operation.
