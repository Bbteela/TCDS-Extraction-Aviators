NOTE 4,"The following parts from TG-6 gliders can be used directly on Taylorcraft D series aircraft. The replacement of 
 such complete component parts is considered a minor repair in accordance with Cam 18.3006: 
 1. 
 Tail surfaces except the fin. 
 2. 
 Landing gear tires and wheels 
 3. 
 Tail wheels. 
 4. 
 Wings. Wings with the spoiler installation should be used only on the model Army L-2M. The spoiler 
 installation should be removed and a suitable covering placed over the upper surface opening on wings for 
 use in other Model D series airplanes. 
 5. 
 Certain parts and assemblies of the control system from (and including) the middle occupant aft. 
 6. 
 Wing struts. 
 7. 
 Instruments, same as or equivalent to those used on powered aircraft. 
 The fuselage primary structure of the TG-6 glider aft of the firewall station can be used on Taylorcraft D series 
 airplanes; however, the use of such parts entails a major repair and must be handled as such in accordance with 
 CAM 18."
