Certification Basis,"FAR 21.25(a) (2) effective February 1, 1965. 
 Type Certificate No. H10NM issued for the purpose of: 
 (1) External Load Operations. Carrying of External Loads as defined in FAR 
 133.1(b), effective December 20, 1976. 
 Note: In accordance with FAR 36.1(a) (4), compliance with the noise requirements 
 was not shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this type certificate are only 
 eligible for external load operations excepted by FAR 
 36.1(a) (4) and defined under FAR 133.1(b). 
 Any alterations to the aircraft for Special Purposes not identified above require 
 further FAA approval and in addition may require flight testing. 
 Prior to original airworthiness certification of each rotorcraft, FAA personnel must 
 perform a conformity inspection to the requirements of this type 
 certificate data sheet and an airworthiness inspection to determine condition for safe 
 operation and determine the applicant has conducted a satisfactory flight test."
Production Basis,None. No helicopters may be produced under this approval.
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the following documents must be in 
 each helicopter for certification:

 06/09/2017 or later FAA approved revision. 
 (3) Equipment as listed in BLR Aerospace LLC Report BLR-AH1-006, Rev B dated 
 12/16/2018 or later FAA approved revision."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight 
 and loading instructions must be in each helicopter at time of original airworthiness certification 
 and at all times thereafter. Refer Operations Manual (TM 55-1520-221-10 or TM 1-1520-236-10) 
 or Appendix D of Maintenance Manual (TM 55-1520-221-23 or TM 55-1520-236-23) for CG

 Refer to Garlick Helicopters, Inc., Drawing No. GH-005 for instructions on 50-hour visual inspection 
 of the Lift Beam Assy. P/N 209-030-141."
NOTE 6,"Torque pressure output by the engine torque sensing system varies with individual engines. A 
 calibration of this value is required on each engine and the value corresponding to take-off power is 
 stamped on the engine data plate."
NOTE 7,"Gas producer speeds as shown under “Engine Limits” are maximum permissible speeds. The gas 
 producer speed for rated power outputs varies with individual engines and must be determined 
 during engine calibration and stamped on the engine data plate. The rated gas producer speed 
 shown on the temperature limit placard installed on the instrument panel must correspond to the 
 data plate."
NOTE 8,"Maximum permissible exhaust gas temperature varies with ambient temperature as described in the 
 Operators Manual. Check engine EGT by use of Health Indicator Test (HIT) prior to take-off (see TM 
 55-1520-221-10, TM 1-1520-234-10 or TM 1-1520-236-10 and HIT Log for the aircraft)."

 Bulletins) and model type improvements will be reviewed for applicability by the Type Certificate 
 holder and may be incorporated by the FAA Form 337."
NOTE 11,"Any Alteration to the type design of this aircraft may require Instructions for Continued 
 Airworthiness (ICA’s). Changes to the Type Design by means of a Supplemental Type Certificate 
 (STC) requiring ICA’s or changes to existing ICA’s must be submitted and reviewed by the Fort 
 Worth Aircraft Evaluation Group (FTW-AEG). Type Design Changes by means of a Field 
 Approval that require ICA’s must have those ICA’s reviewed by the Flight Standards District Office 
 (FSDO) managing the Field Approval or the FTW-AEG."
