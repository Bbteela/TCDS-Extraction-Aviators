 required to provide the information to the local Manufacturing Inspection District Office (MIDO), 
 Manufacturing Inspection Field Representative (MIFR), or Manufacturing Inspection Satellite Office 
 (MISO). After February 24, 1981, Sikorsky Aircraft will not provide Type Design information regarding 
 eligibility and modifications to be accomplished for airworthiness certification of any military version of the 
 S-58 type rotorcraft."
NOTE 9,"Except for a difference in Maximum Weight, the following models are identical to each other including all

NOTE 10,"Initially the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft PT6T-3 engine installation in the S-58B and S-58E was approved via 
 a Supplemental Type Certificate (SH71EA dated 15 April 1971, amended 27 May 1971, 5 November 1971 
 and 21 January 1972) issued to Sikorsky Aircraft. Subsequently, Sikorsky Aircraft requested that the 
 turbine configured aircraft be added to Helicopter Type Certificate 1H11 as new models, which was 
 accomplished on 18 February 1972 and 27, March 1972. Special service instructions are provided in SSI 
 129A for conversion to turbine aircraft."
NOTE 11,"The Pratt & Whitney Aircraft PT6T-3 engine may be installed in a military aircraft which has been 
 converted to either an S-58B, S-58D, S-58E, S-58H or S-58J under the provisions of NOTE 6, 7, and 8."
NOTE 12,"Supplement No. 16 to Item 401(a) became Rotorcraft Flight Manual SA4047-17, Item 401(s) for S-58T

NOTE 14,"Use of the combustion heater installed on rotorcraft equipped with Pratt & Whitney Aircraft PT6T-6 or 
 PT6T-3 engine power package is prohibited unless the heater installation is FAA approved for operation 
 with turbine engine type fuels."
