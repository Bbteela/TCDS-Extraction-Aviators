 (a) Current weight and balance report, including list of equipment included in certificated empty weight, and 
 loading instructions, must be provided for each aircraft at the time of original certification. Convair 
 Report ZW-30-029-, ""Weight and Balance Report,"" for Airplane No. "", is applicable to both the 
 Model 30 and 30A as indicated therein. 
 (b) The airplane must be loaded so that the C.G. is within the specified limits at all times, with the effects of 
 fuel use, gear retraction and crew and passenger movement being considered. See ""C.G. Range"" for 
 restrictions on center of gravity limits for takeoff at gross weights below 155,000 lb. 
 (c) The weight of system fuel and oil as defined below and hydraulic fluid, all of which must be included in 
 the airplane empty weight, is listed in Convair Report ZM-30-069, ""Master Equipment List, Models 30 
 and 30A."" 
 System Fuel: The weight of all fuel required to fill all lines and tanks up to the zero fuel point on the fuel 
 gages in the most critical flight altitude. This includes the unusable tank fuel as defined by CAR 4b.416. 
 System Oil Including Usable: The weight of oil remaining in the engine, constant speed drive, thrust 
 reverser, tanks and lines after subtracting the usable and reverser reserve oil from the total capacity. These 
 values are noted under ""Oil Capacity"" and must be added to the empty weight of the airplane. 
 (d) The ""unusable"" fuel, including drainable and undrainable quantities, is the amount of fuel in the tanks 
 which is unavailable to the engines under critical flight conditions as defined by CAR 4b.416 and may be 
 obtained by taking the difference between ""total refuel"" and ""usable"" tank capacities shown under ""Fuel 
 Capacity."" This ""unusable"" fuel is included in System Fuel as indicated in 1(c) above. 
 (e) Fuel loading and usable procedures are dictated by structural design and to maintain airplane C.G. within 
 approved limits. Refer to Convair Report ZW-30-029-, the airplane weight and balance report for the 
 Model 30 and 30A for loading, takeoff and landing fuel distribution limitations. 
 (f) Fuel Jettison: Fuel jettisoning must be available for operation of the airplane in excess of the maximum 
 landing weight. Refer to FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual for limitations to be observed during 
 fuel jettison operation. The unjettisonable fuel must be included in the airplane landing weight and the 
 amount of usable fuel remaining in the tanks after complete jettisoning is as follows:

 Bulletin 990 S.B. No. 28-12. 
 Fuel weights are based on 6.7 lb./gal. 
 NOTE 2 
 Reserved. 
 NOTE 3 
 All replacement seats (crew, passenger and lounge), although they may comply with TSO-C39, must also be 
 demonstrated to comply with CAR 4b.358(c). Other installations, such as berths, buffets, compartments or 
 items of mass which could create a hazard to the safety of passengers and crew must also be demonstrated to 
 meet the same requirements. 
 NOTE 4 
 The 30-5, 30-6, 30-8, 30A-5, 30A-6, 30A-6AASC, and 30A-8 are versions of the basic Model 30 and 30A, 
 respectively, the certification basis for which is Type Certificate No. 4A30. These dash numbers were selected 
 by Convair primarily for contractual and clerical purposes and should not be considered to define different 
 models of airplanes. One version may be converted to another by incorporating pertinent required equipment 
 and complete conformity with corresponding approved drawings. 
 It should be noted that the identification plate in the cockpit identifies the specific airplane version and that 
 different airplane flight manuals, primarily the result of different autopilot installations, air-conditioning 
 system, and electrical system, are applicable. Accordingly, when converting from one version to another, the 
 identification plate must be suitably revised. The airplane flight manual pertinent to the new version must also 
 be installed. 
 Model 30 airplanes may be modified to like versions of Model 30A airplanes in accordance with Addendum I 
 to General Dynamics/Convair Report ZM-30-070, dated September 28, 1962, ""FAA Certification Drawing 
 Index. When Model 30 airplanes are modified to model 30A airplanes, the ""Nameplate"" must be revised to 
 indicate Model 30A, and the date of modification must be shown.
