Import Requirements,"“Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the United States of 
 both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to identify any required statements 
 by the exporting authority on the export certificate of airworthiness (or equivalent document), and 
 for procedures for coordinating exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to 
 FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance of an 
 airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft.” 
 To be considered eligible for operation in the United States, each aircraft manufactured under this 
 Type Certificate must have a U.S. Airworthiness Certificate that may be issued on the basis of the 
 Canadian Department of Transport Certificate of Airworthiness for Export signed by the Minister 
 of Transport containing the following statement: 
 “The rotorcraft covered by this certificate has been examined, tested and found to comply with the 
 type design approved under Type Certificate R00003RD and to be in condition for safe operation.” 
 The approved type design for the model 429 consists of data listed on Bell top drawing 429-100- 
 001, Revision CG, or later approved revision for serial numbers 57001 and subsequent. 
 The U.S. airworthiness certification basis for aircraft certificated under 14 CFR 21.29 and exported 
 by the country of manufacture is 14 CFR 21.183(c) or 21.185(c)."
Production Basis,None. See Import Requirements.

Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations (see 
 Certification Basis) must be installed in the helicopter for certification. 
 In addition, the following items of equipment are required: 
 Transport Canada approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual BHT-429-FM-1 dated June 19, 2009 or later 
 approved revision. 
 Refer to approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual for other approved mandatory and optional equipment."
Service Information,"Bell Canada Service bulletins, structural repair manuals, vendor manuals, aircraft flight manuals, 
 and overhaul and maintenance manuals, which contain a statement that the document is (Transport 
 Canada) approved, are accepted by the FAA and are considered FAA approved. These approvals 
 pertain to the approved type design only."
NOTE 1,"This type certificate is for a Day/Night VFR operation (Single or Dual Pilot); Instrument Flight 
 Rules (IFR) Operations (Single or Dual) Pilot: Category A, Normal Category Rotorcraft with 
 engine isolation."
NOTE 2,Certification Noise Levels are detailed in the approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual.
NOTE 3,"Current weight and balance report including list of required equipment and list of equipment 
 included in certificated empty weight, and loading instructions when necessary must be provided 
 for each helicopter at the time of original certification."
NOTE 4,"PW207D1 is a derivative of the PW207D with increased mechanical power and without fuel heater. 
 The PW207D2 is identical to the PW207D1 but has a fuel heater installed."
NOTE 5,"The following placard must be displayed in front of and in clear view of the pilot: “THIS 
 HELICOPTER MUST BE OPERATED IN COMPLIANCE WITH OPERATING LIMITATIONS 
 SPECIFIED IN THE APPROVED FLIGHT MANUAL”. 
 All placards listed in the approved flight manual must be installed in the specified locations."
NOTE 6,"Information essential to the proper maintenance of the helicopter is contained in the Manufacturer’s 
 Maintenance Manual provided with each helicopter. The approved service lives, mandatory 
 inspections and other approved supplemental procedures of components are listed in approved 
 Chapter 4, Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Maintenance Manual BHT-429-MM-01, dated 
 June 19, 2009 or later approved revision."
NOTE 7,"The Bell 429 rotorcraft employs electronic engine controls, commonly named Full Authority 
 Digital Engine Controls (FADEC) that are recognized to be more susceptible to Electromagnetic 
 Interference (EMI) than rotorcraft that have manual (non-electronic) controls. EMI may be the 
 result of radiated or conducted interference. For this reason, modifications that add or change 
 systems that have the potential for EMI, must either be qualified to a standard acceptable to the 
 FAA or tested at the time of installation for interference to the FADEC. This type of testing must 
 employ the particular FADEC diagnostic techniques and external diagnostic techniques. The test 
 procedure must be approved."
NOTE 8,Deleted.
NOTE 9,"The model 429 incorporates an emergency OEI limit override function. When this feature is 
 selected, damage to the engine and transmission is experienced and continued flight is not 
 permitted. Use of this emergency power invalidates the airworthiness of the aircraft. Maintenance 
 in accordance with the model 429 Maintenance Manual is required to return the aircraft to an 
 airworthy condition."
NOTE 10,"Effective December 16, 2019 the name Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited was revised to Bell Textron
