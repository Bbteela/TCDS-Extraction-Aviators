Certification Basis,"FAR Part 29 dated February 1, 1965, 
 (Transport Category A), Amendments 29-1 through 29-11 and portions of 29-12, 
 specifically 29.25(c), 29.563, 29.801 and 29.865; 29-14, specifically 29.1351(d); 
 and FAA letter dated June 1, 1981, regarding additional requirements. 
 Equivalent safety findings have been made to the following certification requirements: 
 FAR 29.351 Yawing Conditions 
 FAR 29.865 External load attaching means 
 FAR 29.807(e) Passenger emergency exits 
 (Ramp Exits) 
 FAR 29.927(c) Additional tests (Rotor drive system) 
 FAR 29.1013(b)(3) Oil Tanks (Expansion Space) 
 FAR 29.923(a)(2), (c) and (o) Rotor drive system and control mechanism tests 
 National Environment Act of 1969 
 Noise Control Act of 1972 
 Compliance has been established with the ditching provisions of 29-563, 
 29.801 and 29.807(d) but excluding 29.1411, 29.1415 and 29.1561. 
 For overwater operations compliance with the applicable Operating Rules 
 and 29.1411, 29.1415 and 29.1561 must be shown."
Production Basis,Production Certificate No. 109.
Equipment,"The basic required equipment as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness 
 regulations (See Certification Basis) must be installed in the helicopter for 
 certification. In addition, the following items of equipment are required 
 with each helicopter: 
 Boeing 234 FAA Approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual up to and including 
 Revision 21 dated September 20, 1994, or later FAA approved revisions. 
 Supplement No. 1, is required when Flight Director - Sperry Flight System AD 650H 
 with MS702 HELCISII Controls is installed dated June 19, 1981, Rev. 1 dated 
 October 2, 1981. 
 Supplement No. 2, dated October 2, 1981, is required with Boeing 234 
 UTILITY - Modified Fuel System: External Fuel Tanks removed and 
 two 500 gallon Internal Fuel Tanks are installed. (Refer to Note 5 for 
 additional details regarding Utility Version of Model 234)."
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in the certificated empty weight, 
 and loading instructions, when necessary, must be provided for each helicopter at the time of original 
 certification. 
 For the Model 234 the system/unusable fuel which must be included in the empty weight is the 
 amount of fuel required to fill the system plumbing up to the undrainable level 4.2 gal. (28.1 lb.) plus unusable 
 fuel in the tanks -7.6 gal. (50.9 lb.). The total amount of system fuel therefore is 11.8 gal. (79 lb.) (+310) 
 For the Model 234 (Utility Version - See Note 5). The undrainable fuel is 4.9 gal. (32.8 lb.) and the unusable 
 fuel is 7.2 gal. (48.2 lb.) for a total system fuel of 12.1 gal. (81.0 lb.) (+272)"
NOTE 2,"The following placard must be displayed in front of and in clear view of the pilot. ""This helicopter 
 must be operated in compliance with the operating limitations specified in the Rotorcraft Flight Manual."""
NOTE 3,"Information essential to the proper maintenance of the helicopter including retirement times and required 
 inspections is contained in the Model 234 Maintenance Manual, Chapter 4 - Airworthiness Limitations Section 
 provided with each helicopter. The values of the retirement times and inspection intervals cannot be changed 
 without FAA Engineering Approval."
NOTE 4,"For all operations below -23C (-10F) ambient temperature or, with engines operating at normal rotor r.p.m., 
 fuel temperature gage indication is 0C or colder all fuel used in the Model 234 must contain Phillips 
 PFA-55MB or MIL-I-27686 anti-icing additive in concentrations of not less than 0.035% nor more than 
 0.15% by volume. See the Rotorcraft Flight Manual."
NOTE 5,"The Model 234 (Utility Version) is the Model 234 configured primarily for cargo and jettisonable external 
 load operations. The external fuel tanks are removed and smaller internal tanks installed. The internal 
 configuration may consist of passenger and/or cargo. The Maximum Gross Weight is 51000 lb. with external 
 jettisonable cargo. Refer to Boeing Vertol Model 234 RFM Supplement No. 2 for all limitations regarding the 
 UTILITY configuration of the Model 234. The Model 234 UTILITY is referenced on Boeing Vertol drawing 
 entitled ""234X0001 Customer Helicopter Assembly - Complete."", as the 234X0001-4 assembly."
