Production Basis,"None. Prior to original airworthiness certification of each aircraft, FAA personnel must 
 perform an airworthiness inspection determining condition for safe operation and 
 determine the applicant has conducted a satisfactory flight test. See NOTE 5 for data on 
 Service Bulletins and ADs."
Certification Basis,"14 CFR part 21 § 21.25 (a) (2) and (b). Type Certificate issued September 25, 1987 for 
 the special purpose of forest and wildlife conservation (firefighting). Date of application 
 May 20, 1986. The modifications incorporated are considered appropriate to the special 
 purpose operation, forest and wildlife conservation (firefighting). The criteria 
 established in Civil Air Regulations Part 4B appropriate to the special purpose operation 
 has been used to evaluate these particular changes and demonstrate that the original level 
 of 
 airworthiness established by the military requirements has not been reduced. A Finding 
 of No Significant Impact (FONSI) for the modified Lockheed (Navy) Model SP-2H 
 (P2V-7) Aircraft has been accomplished and approved on September 23, 1987. A 
 finding under the applicable provisions of the Noise Control Act of 1972 has been 
 accomplished and approved on September 23, 1987, for the modified Lockheed SP-2H 
 (P2V-7) Aircraft (Restricted Category-Military Surplus)."
Equipment,"The basic required equipment, as prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations 
 (see Certification Basis) must be installed in the aircraft for certification. Equipment 
 necessary for the particular special purpose operation must be installed. In addition, an 
 FAA approved Airplane Flight Manual Supplement is required. (See NOTES 2 & 4)"
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated 
 empty weight, and loading instructions when necessary must be provided for in each 
 aircraft at the time of original airworthiness certification."
NOTE 2,"The aircraft shall be operated in accordance with NATOPS Flight Manual Navy Model 
 SP-2H Aircraft NAVAIR 01-75EEB-1 (procedures and limitations) and Flight Handbook 
 Navy Model P2V-6 Aircraft AN-01-75EEA-1 (performance) except wherein superseded 
 by Aero Union Corporation FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual Supplement dated 
 September 22, 1987 original issue or later approved revision."
