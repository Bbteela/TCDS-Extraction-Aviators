Interior Equipment,"401. (a) Airplane Flight Manual, CAA (FAA) Approved, May 21, 1948. 
 (b) Skiplane Supplement to Manual as follows: 
 ""Performance Information with Ski Installation: 
 Climb: Skiplane climb performance is essentially equal to that of the landplane. 
 Take-off and landing: Under the most favorable conditions of smooth packed snow 
 temperatures approximating 30° F, skiplane take-off distance is essentially equal to the 
 landplane distance. Landing distance is approximately 20% greater than the 
 landplane distance. In applying the performance data, caution should be exercised in 
 that lower temperatures or other snow conditions will increase the ski friction and hence 
 increase the take-off run and decrease the landing run."""
NOTE 1,"Current weight and balance report including list of equipment included in certificated weight empty, and 
 loading instructions when necessary, must be in each aircraft at the time of original certification and at all 
 times thereafter (except in the case of air carrier operators having an approved weight control system)."
