 (b) Skiplane Supplement to manual as follows: 
 ""Performance Information with Ski Installation: 
 Climb: Skiplane climb performance is essentially equal to that of the landplane. 
 Take-off and landing: Under the most favorable conditions of smooth packed snow, 
 temperatures approximating 30°F, skiplane take-off distance is essentially 
 equal to the landplane distance. Landing distance is approximately 20% 
 greater than the landplane distance. In applying the performance data, 
 caution should be exercised in that lower temperatures or other snow 
 conditions will increase the ski friction and hence increase the take-off run 
 and decrease the landing run."""
