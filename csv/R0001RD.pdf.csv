Serial Nos Eligible,"1001 and subsequent. A French (DGAC) Certificate of Airworthiness endorsed as noted 
 below under “Import Requirements” must be submitted for each individual rotorcraft for 
 which application for FAA certification is made."
Serial Nos Ineligible,"The FAA has revoked the standard airworthiness certificate of serial number 1137 on an 
 emergency basis, based on a determination of un-airworthiness sufficient to render the 
 certificate ineffective. This serial number aircraft is not currently eligible for a Standard 
 Certificate of Airworthiness. Inquiries regarding this aircraft should be directed to the FAA 
 Rotorcraft Directorate Staff, Fort Worth, TX."

 the European Community. 
 Refer to the applicable bilateral agreement to verify eligibility for import into the 
 United States of both new and used aircraft based on the scope of the agreement, to 
 identify any required statements by the exporting authority on the export certificate

 exceptions to conformity statements on these documents. Refer to FAA 
 Order 8130.2, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft, for requirements for issuance 
 of an airworthiness certificate for imported aircraft. 
 The Export C of A should contain the following statement: “The aircraft covered 
 by this certificate has been examined, tested, and found to comply with the type 
 design approved under U.S. Type Certificate Number R0001RD and to be in a 
 condition for safe operation.”"
