 3) 
 External Load Operation under 14 CFR Part 21, § 21.25(b)(7). 
 Note: In accordance with 14 CFR Part 36, § 36.1(a)(4), compliance with the noise 
 requirements was not shown. Therefore, aircraft certificated under this type 
 certificate are only eligible for external loads operations excepted by § 36.1(a)(4) 
 and defined under 14 CFR Part 133, § 133.1(b). 
 Any alteration to the aircraft for Special Purposes not identified above requires 
 further FAA approval and in addition may require noise and/or flight testing.
