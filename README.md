# EXTRACT CONTENT FROM UNSTRUCTURED TYPE CERTIFICATE DATA SHEET
## This Project is sponsored by the FAA and the Data Analytics Department of GMU
### Team Aviators

The Type Certificate Data Sheetis (TCDS) is a design approval administered by the FAA that records information about each aircraft model. Most TCDS are stored in the form of PDF files, so there are many inconveniences in the process of adding or modifying. The purpose of this project is to automatically convert unstructured TCDS into structured messages, and to provide queryers with the most relevant TCDS content for the input message.

### Requirements Environment
Most of us using Conda Environment, but the requirements.txt is updated on the repo.

### Overviews of the repo
Folder dataset_tcds contains all the tcds we was working on, and folder csv contains the products after processing.
